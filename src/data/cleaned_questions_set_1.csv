2 - What is knowledge?	When interrelations are formed between experiences that are logical and consistent,  results in knowledge . Knowledge and information are different in that knowledge is obtained via direct experience and logic, while information can be obtained through sources other than our direct experience and logic, such as books or Gurus.	Information that can be trusted is knowledge 	Knowledge is information gained by reading textbooks, scriptures.	knowledge is information gained directly from authentic sources like scientists, experts etc.	Whatever Guru says is knowledge.	Whatever the education system teaches is knowledge 		Translation of experiential information to form memory . It's helpful for survival. Knowlegde of earlier experience assits in sustaining & further evolving of layers.	Interrelations of Experience organized in memory is the definition of knowledge in the Path of Knowledge program. Knowledge and information are different in that knowledge is obtained via direct experience and logic, while information can be obtained through sources other than our direct experience and logic, such as books or Gurus.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=4&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	Pandurang 	Muni	Verified

This leads to choose & cultivate actions from  higher layers.	Genuine curiosity and interest in spiritual matters is required to even begin on a spiritual path. Further, intense desire for knowledge and liberation is required. Subgoals of the path can include other important qualities of a seeker which include attention, one's intellect, open minded skepticism, and other critical thinking abilities.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=3&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	Nick	Muni	Verified
4 - Why is all that changes false?	All that changes is false because the criterion for truth is that which is unchanging	All that changes is not false	Change implies impermanence. it will not remain, that's why it's false.	That which changes is an illusion, therefore it is not what it seems	All that changes is unreliable and ultimately false	There is no true or false		It remains mutable & over a period tends to remain meaningless.	True is subjective and arbitrary and dependent upon the criterion used for truth. In the PoK we define truth as that which is unchanging. Therefore, anything that does not meet that criterion is considered false.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=7&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	Nick	Muni	Verified
5 - If knowledge comes from experience, which is false, how can we say that it is knowledge?	Knowledge is subtractive and nothing is ultimately gained.	Knowledge of the false Illusion is necessary for self-realization.	Even though Experience is false, the brain stores Experience in Local Memory and we refer to that as knowledge.	The Experiencer gains knowledge of itself through false, illusory forms which leads to self-realization.	Books and Guru's impart knowledge through their Experience and if it fits with our direct experience, we then can call it knowledge.	Not all experience is false. The one and only true experience is self-realization, and that is knowledge.		Experience is superficial & appears real. It is limited information that is gathered by sensory organs which is meaningful for survival. It becomes knowledge when realised for it's transitory nature. It helps in dropping mental concepts & emotional imbalance. 	We utilize the Experience, which is illusory and false, to reduce ignorance and blind beliefs via knowledge. Therefore, knowledge is a tool derived from the illusion to lead us to that which is true through subtracting all that is false.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=4&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Muni	Verified
6 - Why is the experiencer limited by experience?	The Experiencer can never be limited by Experience.	Since the Experiencer and Experience are one, they are both limited by the senses.	For survival purposes.	The Existence can only appear to itself through a limited Experiencer	The Experiencer desires form. Thus the formless takes the form of the Experience	Nothing can be known unless the Experiencer is limited by Experience		It is the absolute neccesity for survival in existence. Perception for seperation assists individual to exist & evolve meaningfully.	The Experiencer is infinite and not limited by Experience. If the Experiencer were limited, we would need to identify and count the limited Experiencers. Who is identifying and counting those limited Experiencers? This shows that the Experiencer is unlimited, infinite, and can never be seen as limited.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=13&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	Nick	Muni	Verified
7 - What is the definition of nature? What happens when it changes?	Nature is the most fundamental essence of something. If it changes, it is not the nature.	Nature is the natural occurence of vibration. When it changes, structures in the memory form.	Nature is the most fundamental essence of something. If it changes, the nature can never be known.	Nature is the phenomenon of the physical world. When it changes, life emerges.	Nature is the phenomenon of the physical world. When it changes, the systems entropy increases	Nature is truth. Truth can never change.		Nature forms governing & meaningingful laws for all entities to survive. When it changes, entities either evlove or perish their earlier knowledge of survival.	Nature is the most fundamental essence of something. In the PoK we attempt to determine the Nature of Existence. We utilize the criterion for truth, which is "that which is unchanging" to determine the Nature of the Existence. We see that the only unchanging aspect of this Existence is the witnessing of Experience, or the Experiencer itself. When we look closer to see what the Nature of the Experiencer is, we see nothing. Only Emptiness. We can reach the conclusion that Emptiness is the Nature of the Existence.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=8&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	Nick	Muni	Verified
8 - Experiencer knows itself via many forms, but why does it need so many forms when it can know itself with one form?	The Experiencer is formless and has no need for form.	To gain knowledge best suitable for it's survival as an individual.	Because form is impermanent, it must identify with infinite forms to know itself	It must obtain many different view points to view the entirety of it's creation	This question falls under the category of unknowable and is thus unanswerable	It only requires one form, which is the causal body in order to know itself.		To gain knowledge best suitable for it's survival as an individual & evolution.	The Experiencer is infinite and formless. It knows itself by being itself.  It is the whole of the Existence. It does not require multiple forms to know itself. 	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=15&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	Nick	Muni	Verified
9 - Establish the illusory nature of all forms.	The essence of form is emptiness and forms do not exist independently. The water appears as a wave but is not separate from it.	All forms are not illusory	Since all is illusion so all forms are illusory	That which changes is untrue, therefore it is an illusion.	All forms are creations of the Experiencer and as creations they are illusory.	It is impossible to establish the illusory nature of all forms		They cannot remain permanent in each passing moment.	The Experience is the part of the Existence that appears to the Experiencer. However, at the level of nonduality, there is nothing to the Experience other than the Experiencing of it. It shares the essence of the Experiencer which is emptiness. Experiences or forms do not exist independently. They are the waves that appear on the water but are not separate from the water.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=19&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	Nick	Muni	Verified
10 - How can we say there is only one experiencer?	If they are many then they must be witnessed. As soon as they are witnessed, they become experience and the one who witnesses them becomes the Experiencer. With this logic, it's impossible to have more than one Experiencer.	We can't say there is only one Experiencer as each person has their own Experiencer.	Because we have not seen it and because other people say, it really must be only one.	We can not say there is only one experiencer.	There is not even one Experiencer, there are no Experiencers.	Each person shares the same Experiencer which is transmitted through our senses.		Experiencer is the background on which all experiences can appear.Since it has no qualities, it remains as default presence in each experience.It is the existence itself, experiencing itself as experience.	The Experiencer is that which witnesses all Experience. If we attempt to count the number of Experiencers, who is the one counting? If we see an Experiencer, that Experiencer becomes an Experience and thus can not be an Experiencer. The Experiencer "stand behind" all Experiences. We take each person as an "Experiencer" because we falsely believe that the Experiencer is this body and mind. The body and mind appear to the Experiencer.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=13&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Muni	Verified
