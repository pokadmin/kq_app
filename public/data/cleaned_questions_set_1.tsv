What is path of knowledge? What is its goal?	It is a spiritual path where goal is destruction of ignorance.	We get all wishes fulfilled here, that is the only goal	It is a lifestyle, where knowledge is gained for success.	It is a way which leads to liberation of the person.	It is a useless activity, only superstition nothing else	A path to obtain knowledge of the entire existence. It's goal is knowledge in and of itself.	The Path of Knowledge is a spiritual path in which knowledge is gained via direct experience and logic. We focus on gaining knowledge of the Existence, who we are,  and our relationship to the Existence. The goal of the Path of Knowledge is destruction of ignorance which ultimately leads to Self-Realization.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=2&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qewg5-101ab3f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Gurufield	Muni	Verified
What is knowledge?	Interrelations that are formed between experiences that are logical and consistent. 	Information that can be trusted is knowledge 	Knowledge is information gained by reading textbooks, scriptures.	knowledge is information gained directly from authentic sources like scientists, experts etc.	Whatever Guru says is knowledge.	Whatever the education system teaches is knowledge 	Interrelations of Experience organized in memory is the definition of knowledge in the Path of Knowledge program. Knowledge and information are different in that knowledge is obtained via direct experience and logic, while information can be obtained through sources other than our direct experience and logic, such as books or Gurus.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=4&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qewg5-101ab3f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Pandurang 	Muni	Verified
Which qualities can be cultivated, which ones cannot be cultivated?	critical thinking, intelligence, and attention can be cultivated. Curiosity can not be cultivated. 	curiosity can be developed, intelligence can not	critical thinking and a desire for knowledge can be cultivated, intelligence can not	knowledge can be cultivated, wisdom can not	attention can be cultivated, awareness can not	no qualities can be cultivated, a seeker arrives with a fixed set of qualities	Genuine curiosity and interest in spiritual matters is required to even begin on a spiritual path. Further, intense desire for knowledge and liberation is required. Subgoals of the path can include other important qualities of a seeker which include attention, one's intellect, open minded skepticism, and other critical thinking abilities.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=3&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qewg5-101ab3f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Why is all that changes false?	All that changes is false because the criterion for truth is that which is unchanging	All that changes is not false	Change implies impermanence. it will not remain, that's why it's false.	That which changes is an illusion, therefore it is not what it seems	All that changes is unreliable and ultimately false	There is no true or false	True is subjective and arbitrary and dependent upon the criterion used for truth. In the PoK we define truth as that which is unchanging. Therefore, anything that does not meet that criterion is considered false.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=7&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qewg5-101ab3f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
If knowledge comes from experience, which is false, how can we say that it is knowledge?	Knowledge is subtractive and nothing is ultimately gained.	Knowledge of the false Illusion is necessary for self-realization.	Even though Experience is false, the brain stores Experience in Local Memory and we refer to that as knowledge.	The Experiencer gains knowledge of itself through false, illusory forms which leads to self-realization.	Books and Guru's impart knowledge through their Experience and if it fits with our direct experience, we then can call it knowledge.	Not all experience is false. The one and only true experience is self-realization, and that is knowledge.	We utilize the Experience, which is illusory and false, to reduce ignorance and blind beliefs via knowledge. Therefore, knowledge is a tool derived from the illusion to lead us to that which is true through subtracting all that is false.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=4&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qewg5-101ab3f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Gurufield	Muni	Verified
Why is the experiencer limited by experience?	The Experiencer can never be limited by Experience.	Since the Experiencer and Experience are one, they are both limited by the senses.	For survival purposes.	The Existence can only appear to itself through a limited Experiencer	The Experiencer desires form. Thus the formless takes the form of the Experience	Nothing can be known unless the Experiencer is limited by Experience	The Experiencer is infinite and not limited by Experience. If the Experiencer were limited, we would need to identify and count the limited Experiencers. Who is identifying and counting those limited Experiencers? This shows that the Experiencer is unlimited, infinite, and can never be seen as limited.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=13&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qewg5-101ab3f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is the definition of nature? What happens when it changes?	Nature is the most fundamental essence of something. If it changes, it is not the nature.	Nature is the natural occurence of vibration. When it changes, structures in the memory form.	Nature is the most fundamental essence of something. If it changes, the nature can never be known.	Nature is the phenomenon of the physical world. When it changes, life emerges.	Nature is the phenomenon of the physical world. When it changes, the systems entropy increases	Nature is truth. Truth can never change.	Nature is the most fundamental essence of something. In the PoK we attempt to determine the Nature of Existence. We utilize the criterion for truth, which is "that which is unchanging" to determine the Nature of the Existence. We see that the only unchanging aspect of this Existence is the witnessing of Experience, or the Experiencer itself. When we look closer to see what the Nature of the Experiencer is, we see nothing. Only Emptiness. We can reach the conclusion that Emptiness is the Nature of the Existence.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=8&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qewg5-101ab3f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Experiencer knows itself via many forms, but why does it need so many forms when it can know itself with one form?	The Experiencer is formless and has no need for form.	To gain knowledge best suitable for it's survival as an individual.	Because form is impermanent, it must identify with infinite forms to know itself	It must obtain many different view points to view the entirety of it's creation	This question falls under the category of unknowable and is thus unanswerable	It only requires one form, which is the causal body in order to know itself.	The Experiencer is infinite and formless. It knows itself by being itself.  It is the whole of the Existence. It does not require multiple forms to know itself. 	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=15&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qewg5-101ab3f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Establish the illusory nature of all forms.	The essence of form is emptiness and forms do not exist independently. The water appears as a wave but is not separate from it.	All forms are not illusory	Since all is illusion so all forms are illusory	That which changes is untrue, therefore it is an illusion.	All forms are creations of the Experiencer and as creations they are illusory.	It is impossible to establish the illusory nature of all forms	The Experience is the part of the Existence that appears to the Experiencer. However, at the level of nonduality, there is nothing to the Experience other than the Experiencing of it. It shares the essence of the Experiencer which is emptiness. Experiences or forms do not exist independently. They are the waves that appear on the water but are not separate from the water.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=19&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qewg5-101ab3f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
How can we say there is only one experiencer?	If they are many then they must be witnessed. As soon as they are witnessed, they become experience and the one who witnesses them becomes the Experiencer.	We can't say there is only one Experiencer as each person has their own Experiencer.	Because we have not seen it and because other people say, it really must be only one.	We can not say there is only one experiencer.	There is not even one Experiencer, there are no Experiencers.	Each person shares the same Experiencer which is transmitted through our senses.	The Experiencer is that which witnesses all Experience. If we attempt to count the number of Experiencers, who is the one counting? If we see an Experiencer, that Experiencer becomes an Experience and thus can not be an Experiencer. The Experiencer "stand behind" all Experiences. We take each person as an "Experiencer" because we falsely believe that the Experiencer is this body and mind. The body and mind appear to the Experiencer.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=13&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qewg5-101ab3f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Gurufield	Muni	Verified

What happens when the seeker does not have required qualities and still tries to practice?	The practices will not be in the right direction and the seeker will be lost and cause self harm	Makes some progress on the spiritual path.	It is a total waste of time and effort.	Seeker develops the qualities because of whatever practice s/he does.	Achieves material success. 	Seeker reaches the spiritual goal still.	Intense desire for knowledge, liberation, and also curiosity are required for a spiritual seeker. If these are not present, it's unlikely that a seeker will even find the Path of Knowledge to begin with. If they do begin the path, interest will be lost quickly without these skills. Further, if they do not develop the secondary qualities of critical thinking or attention, progress will be halted and they will likely revert back to old habits such as believing blind beliefs and will not use their direct experience and logic to acquire knowledge.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=3&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Muni	Nick	Verified
When we get knowledge, what do we get essentially?	We don't get anything, all ignorance is dropped 	We realize how to be successful in the world.	We get knowledge of various spiritual paths. 	We get knowledge about ourself and the world.	We get increased Awareness	We get bliss and happiness	In the Path of Knowledge, knowledge is defined as an organization of Experiences within the Memory. The knowledge we seek on the PoK is subtractive, that is, it removes our blind beliefs and ignorance, bringing us to our essence. Bliss, happiness, freedom, arise naturally from this.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=4&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Muni	Nick	Verified
Why is a guru not a valid means of knowledge? Why do we still need a guru?	Guru will provide information which still needs to be validated by seeker through his own experience. 	Guru is a valid means of knowledge.	Guru is not a valid means of knowledge because we do not know whether he is trustworthy or not. We still need him to share practices with us. 	Knowledge is received through scriptures. We still need a Guru to interpret the scriptures for us. 	Guru is not a valid means because he is a person. We still need him because the tradition demands a Guru. 	Guru is not a valid means of knowledge and we do not need a Guru.	Everything other than direct experience and logic should be considered information, including the Guru. Information can point us to the knowledge but it is up to us to see for ourselves. It is important to critically appraise all information including that which comes from a Guru.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=5&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Muni	Nick	Verified
Who is transformed by Self realisation?	Nobody is transformed. Transformation happens and there is freedom from the person.	The person.	Mind and body.	Nobody is transformed. 	Self realisation is a myth.	Soul	Self-realization is the recognition that we are not any thing that can be pointed to within our Experience, including the mind or body. We realize that we are pure subjectivity, or the Experiencer itself. Second, we see that the Experiencer can not be separate from the Experience. There can not be two. We see that we are the whole Existence. Ultimately, no person or individual is transformed. There was no person or individual to begin with, only oneness.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=15&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Muni	Nick	Verified
What is nondual truth?	In non-duality there is oneness that embraces both truth and false. 	There is no false.	Everything is false.	Truth is supreme.	There is only one existence.	Experiencer and experience are the same.	Non-dual truth can not be expressed in words. We are the whole of the Existence, One. Silence is the only expression for this. The moment we attempt to describe Non-dual truth, we objectify it and duality arises.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=20&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Muni	Nick	Verified
What is memory?	A pattern of vibrations which can take on form of other patterns. It "Stores" the incoming change and can be "Played back" later.	Memory is humans ability to recall something	Memory is storage space in human brain	Experiences are memory	Memory is not a thing, it is the Experiencer appearing as a form so that it can Experience itself in many forms.	Memory is a function of the brain which stores the incoming vibrations as a formatted sensory input	In the realm of Experience, the fundamental building block is vibration, a simple binary state change. There is also a tendency towards survival or reduction of disorder. These vibrations superimpose and self-perpetuate. Eventually, vibrational patterns arise that can take on incoming vibrations and can "replay" the incoming patterns. This is called Memory. Memory can then build more complex structures that filter incoming data for the benefit of the structure, these are called the senses. Remember that this explanation is firmly in the realm of "illusion" or the Experience and can not be said to be True based on our criteria for truth. It is a model to explain the Experience.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=23&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Pandurang 	Nick	Verified
What is the difference between waking, dreaming and projected states?	Essentially they are the same but the experiences in each can be different. Operating senses in each state are different.	Waking is real but dreaming is unreal. Projected is also unreal.	Realisation is possible in waking and not in dreaming or projected.	Dreaming is in lower layer and waking in higher layer	The brain waves are vibrating at various patterns which produce a specific state.	The Experiencer is different in each state depending on the particular senses that are aquired in that state.	Once we have the knowledge that we are the Experiencer of all Experiences and that we are actually the whole Existence itself, we see that there is fundamental difference between waking, dreaming, or projected. Experiences arise there which will change. The Experiences will be witnessed by You, the Experiencer. We take the waking state to be "real" and the other states to be false simply due to the appearance of stability and our familiarity with our stable, 5 senses. Change is slower in the waking state compared to the other states. Other states may also have different senses compared to the waking state senses.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=36&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Pandurang 	Nick	Verified
Which layers are needed for awareness?	Higher layers that go beyond intellect, as well as all of the lower layers.	Layers are not needed.	Refined emotional layers can give one the experience of awareness	Experience of oneness	Layer where one experiences love	Layer of intellect	In order for Awareness to arise, which is the knowledge that "I Am the Experiencer", "this Experience is illusory", or "I Am this Existence" we must go beyond intellect and at the same time we must also have all of the lower layers in working order. For example, if the most basic survival needs are not met, this entity will be searching for food or shelter, rather than inquiring about the nature of it's existence. Intellect and critical thinking allows us to investigate until the light of Awareness is known directly but again, will not arise until all lower layers are adequately tended to.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=29&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Muni	Nick	Verified
How to go beyond the illusion?	You are already beyond the illusion right now. 	Through meditation.	Through grace of Guru.	By understanding the illusion.	By gaining knowledge.	By dropping ignorance.	No action will take one beyond the illusion, it is a recognition which is here and now that shows you are already beyond the illusion. You are the Experiencer of the illusion and ultimately the Existence itself	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=15&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Muni	Nick	Verified
How can the limited know the unlimited?	Limited cannot know the unlimited.	By becoming the unlimited.	Through realisation.	By dropping the mind.	Through special senses.	Through refined intelligence.	Knowing implies that something was experienced and logically organized in the memory. In order for something to be known, it must be formatted by the senses in such a way that it is useful and logical. Thus, we perceive Experience to be limited because it relies on the limits of the senses. By definition, the limited can never "know" the unlimited because the unlimited can not be limited. If we could ever know the unlimited it will become limited. Therefore, we can only be the unlimited we can never know the unlimited.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=12&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent		Muni	Nick	Verified

What is the goal of the path of knowledge and what is gained here?	reduction of ignorance, nothing is gained	happiness and freedom, improvement in worldly interactions and relationships	freedom from suffering, knowledge of the existence	happiness and freedom, increased awareness	maintaining awareness at all times, attention and focus	destruction of the ego, knowledge of the existence	Although freedom, happiness, improvement in worldly interactions and relations, as well as increased attention and awareness can occur as side effects on the path of knowledge, these are not the goal. The goal is reduction of ignorance through the acquisition of knowledge. This is a subtractive path and nothing is gained.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=2&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nqdnd-10a4407?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is the universal truth which is accepted by everyone?	There is no universal truth accepted by everyone	Life is suffering	Our essence is unknowable	The origin of the universe is unknowable	Science is the key to explaining the universe	Ignorance is the cause of suffering	Truth is subjective and arbitrary. Everyone has a different criteria for truth. Truth is dependent upon the criteria which defines it. Therefore, there can not be a universal truth accepted by all. In the Path of Knowledge we define truth as that which is unchanging. All else is false, or illusion.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=7&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nqdnd-10a4407?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is the nature of the Existence?	Emptiness	Energy	Space	Sub atomic particles 	doesn't have nature	God	The Existence appears to have two aspects: that which is changing and that which is unchanging. The Experience which is ever changing and the Experiencer, which is unchanging. Essence is defined as the most fundamental, perfect, and unchanging component of a system. Therefore, the essence of the Existence is that which is unchanging, or the Experiencer. Going one step further, when we search to find exactly what this Experiencer is, we find nothing. When we look at the Experience we can not find any object which stands independently of the Experiencer. Therefore, we say that the essence of the Existence is emptiness.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=12&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nqdnd-10a4407?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Pandurang 	Muni	Verified
If it is not an object, how is the Experiencer known?	By being the Experiencer	Through logic and inference. If there is an experience, there must be an experiencer	Through progressive elimination of what is not me (Neti-Neti)	Through awareness practice	Through attention practice	Through direct experience in the waking, dreaming, and projected states	Although the Experiencer can be inferred, given that there is the appearance of objects and objects can not appear without an Experiencer, the only way to "know" the Experiencer is by being the Experiencer. Many practices, such as progressive elimination (neti-neti) and meditative practices can help one become the Experiencer but they are not required. Only reduction of ignorance is required to see that you are the Experiencer.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=14&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nqdnd-10a4407?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
When the Experiencer is without any qualities, why do we say it is blissful?	Bliss is the absence of all qualities, thus the Experiencer is bliss	Realizing the Experiencer causes joy and happiness for the person	It allows for a sense of oneness with all things	Through the Experiencer, we experience Nirvana	The Experiencer loves and accepts everything	Because the Experiencer is perfect in all ways	"Bliss is emptiness and emptiness is bliss". Bliss is the absence of happiness, sadness and all states of the mind. The Experiencer itself is Emptiness. Therefore the Experiencer is bliss. 	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=14&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nqdnd-10a4407?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
If it is all Emptiness, how can things exist at all?	Through the potential of emptiness	Through atomic and molecular organization	There is nothing, there is no existence of anything	Through the senses and the mind	It is a creation of the Experiencer	Through the "big bang"	In the Path of Knowledge, emptiness does not mean that nothing exists at all, it means that nothing exists independently and that there is no essential substance which creates objects. At the most fundamental level, all we can say is that this emptiness has a potential to appear as illusory forms.   	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=12&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nqdnd-10a4407?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is the evidence for Vibration?	The observation of change	There is no evidence, it's only a concept	Scientific experiments	In meditative states, the vibrations can be observed in the mind	Through direct observation via the five senses	Mathematical derivation	Change is the evidence for vibration.  We know by direct experience that all Experience is changing. The most basic change would be the root of all phenomenon. A change must have at least two states. Not less and not more. By necessity, the simplest change must have two states, which is called a binary change. We call this binary change a vibration. This is the basic building block of all Experience.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=22&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nqdnd-10a4407?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
The layered structure of memory is evolving, what happens to it in the end?	Dissolution	The Atman merges with the Brahman	Knowledge of the entire Existence	A higher intellect is achieved	Nirvana	Awakening or self-realization	Evolution of the layered structure of memory eventually leads to the dissolved layer, or the universal memory, which is not really a layer, but a container for all layers. Although awakening and liberation are part of the evolution of the layered memory, they are not the highest layer of the memory structure.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=29&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nqdnd-10a4407?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
After knowing my nondual nature, what should be my behaviour, how should I conduct my life? What is our goal here as a human being?	After realizing your nondual nature, you are free to do what you would like within the illusion. Minimalist lifestyle, the human goal is happiness and freedom	Helping others in need, human goal is to be compassionate to all beings	Fulfill all desires, the goal is fulfillment of desire	Ethics and conduct are relative, do nothing, the human goal is to maintain awareness at all times	Helping others in need, maintain awareness at all times	Act spontaneously, our goal is to abide in our true nature	After realizing your nondual nature, you are free to do what you would like within the illusion. There is nothing more to know and nothing more important than self-realization. We know that ignorance resulting from indoctrination and blind beliefs are what lead to suffering. A minimilist lifestyle without becoming enmeshed in the burdens of daily life will promote knowledge and the dropping of ignorance.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=16&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nqdnd-10a4407?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is unconditional love, how is it related to my true nature?	Oneness is unconditional love, and the Experiencer is not separate from the Experience and is Existence itself.	Unconditional love is loving no matter what, which is what the Experiencer does	Unconditional love is not possible, all love is conditional	Unconditional love is freedom and can be felt via self-realization	Unconditional love is oneness with all things, the Experiencer allows the person to love all things	Unconditional love is loving no matter what and can only be felt through the connection of the student and guru	Unconditional love is non-separation, oneness. When we realize our true nature, we know we are the Experiencer and thus we are the whole of the Existence. This is oneness. Therefore, we are not separate from anyone or anything in this existence. We are unconditional love.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=20&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nqdnd-10a4407?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified

What is the difference between knowledge and truth?	Knowledge is organization and interrelation of experiences, truth is a categorization of experience.	There is no difference.	Knowledge is obtained via direct experience, truth is obtained via logic.	There is no difference, both remove ignorance.	Knowledge is subjective and arbitrary and truth is unchanging.	Knowledge is unchanging, truth removes ignorance.	In the PoK we define knowledge as an organization or interrelation of experience within the memory. Truth is arbitrary and subjective. It depends on the definition. In the PoK we define Truth as that which is not changing. Truth is thus a categorization of Experience. We categorize Experience as either changing (false) or unchanging (true).	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=7&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-ctki5-10a8bcb?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Can we get knowledge from scriptures or books?	No, knowledge is only obtained via direct experience and logic.	Yes, if you are in agreement with the author.	Yes, but only if they are from valid sources of knowledge, such as a Guru.	Yes, if the knowledge fits with our direct experience.	No, only the words directly from a Guru will allow for knowledge.	Yes, if the book removes ignorance.	Scriptures, books, Gurus, podcasts, and anything other than our direct experience and logic is considered information. Direct experience and logic are our only valid means of knowledge on the PoK. All else is considered information. Information can point us to knowledge but it is not the knowledge itself. 	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=5&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-ctki5-10a8bcb?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is the difference between your true nature and nature of a rock?	There is no difference.	My true nature is emptiness, the rock's is unknown.	Both are potential.	My true nature is the Experiencer, the rock's is the Experience.	Vibrations are the true nature of both.	Potential is my true nature, the rock's is unknown.	Essence is defined as the most fundamental, unchanging building block. Anything that is changing can not be our Essence. We see that the only unchanging aspect of this Existence is the Experiencer. What is the Essence of the Experiencer? Nothing that can be pointed to directly, it has no characteristics. We also see that the Experiencer is the Existence itself. There is no difference between the Experiences or the Experiencer within this Existence. If the Essence of the Experiencer is Emptiness we must say that the Essence of the Existence is Emptiness. Thus, anything that arises within this Existence can be said to have the same Essence, or True Nature, and that is Emptiness.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=20&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-ctki5-10a8bcb?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
 Are you a body?	No, the body is an Experience.	No, but the Experiencer takes the form of a body.	No, but the body creates the Experiencer	I am the causal body, not the physical body	I am the physical body in this state but an astral body in the projected state	It can not be known if I am the body	In the PoK we define the Self, our True Nature, or Essence as that which is unchanging. We can see that the body is changing and impermanent, thus can not be our True Nature, Self, or Essence. We are the unchanging Experiencer of all changing Experiences. Thus, we are not the body. The body is an Experience. The same holds for the mind or ego.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=16&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-ctki5-10a8bcb?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Where is the experiencer in this body?	There is no location of the Experiencer.	At the crown chakra	At the third eye chakra	At the heart center	It pervades the entire body	Within the pre-frontal cortex	Due to blind belief and lack of investigation, we falsely believe that the Experiencer arises within the body, usually somewhere in the head region. There is a sense of locality in this region which is beneficial for the survival of the organism. Although, when we look closely, we see that the Experiencer is non-local. If we can point to an object (such as our body) and say "that is the Experiencer", the Experiencer becomes the Experience. Where is the Experiencer? Always, "behind" the Experience. Thus, the Experiencer is not located in the body. It is non-local.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=13&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-ctki5-10a8bcb?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
 If I am the whole existence, and all experience is also existence why can't I know all the experiences?	The senses limit Experience	Lack of meditative skills and Siddhis	The brain does not allow for an experience of the whole	You can know all Experiences at once	The Experiencer can only view one Experience at a time	Lack of Awareness	In this question, the word "know" implies a knower and a known. In order for their to be a known, the whole or unlimited must be limited so that the knower has a tangible, orderly Experience which is impressed upon the memory. The senses are developed for the purpose of survival. They limit sensory input to that which is beneficial to the organism. Thus, the whole, or unlimited must, by definition, be limited to be known. This is why "we" with our limited senses and local memory can never have a tangible Experience of the whole Existence.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=12&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-ctki5-10a8bcb?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is the meaning of illusion?	Something that is not what it appears to be	A simulated reality	that which is a modified representation of the truth	the true aspect of the Existence	that which changes	that which is deceptive	Illusion is an appearance which is not what it actually is. In the PoK this is also known as Maya. Illusion is the closest word in English to Maya. Maya implies that there is actually nothing to the illusions that arise, there isn't anything "behind" the appearance which is real, only Emptiness. All Experience can be seen as illusory from the perspective of the Experiencer. 	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=21&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-ctki5-10a8bcb?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is awareness?	Knowledge that I Am the Experiencer	Focus on a particular object	hypervigilance in all activities	the ability to note the arisings and passings of Experience	mindfulness	breath based meditation	Awareness is recollection that there is an Experiencer and that this Experience is illusory. It is not a meditative technique. Awareness is cutlivated by abiding as the Witness of all Experience. With time, eventually abiding will occur 24/7.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=17&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-ctki5-10a8bcb?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
How can we know the nondual nature of the existence?	It can not be known, we can only be the Existence.	Through the Guru's teachings	Through silencing of the mind	Through progressive elimination or "Neti Neti"	By attention and awareness practice	By witnessing the merging of the Experiencer and Experience	Knowing implies a "known" and a "knower". Knowing is a term that applies to duality. Thus, we can never know the nondual nature. We gain knowledge of the Self and recognize we are the Experiencer of all Experience. The next step is to see that the Experience is not separate from the Experiencer and thus we are the whole Existence. We can only be the Existence, the whole, or the Experience, we can never know it intellectually.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=20&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-ctki5-10a8bcb?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
How to be blissful always?	You are already blissful, always.	Through the Guru's grace	Through silencing of the mind	Through progressive elimination or "Neti Neti"	By attention and awareness practice	By witnessing the merging of the Experiencer and Experience	In the PoK bliss is defined as the absence of all emotional states. The Experiencer is free of suffering, sadness, excitement, happiness, and all other states which are subject to change. We therefore call it eternally blissful. When we see that we are the Experiencer, we realize we are blissful and will always be blissful.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=16&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-ctki5-10a8bcb?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified

What do we need to do on the path of knowledge to get knowledge?	Use direct experience and logic	Listen to the Guru	Read scriptures	Critically appraise the information that is given	Attention and awareness practices	Serve the Guru to get knowledge	Knowledge is defined as an organization of experience within the memory. Direct experience and logic are the only valid means of knowledge on the PoK. Ultimately, knowledge gained is subtractive, meaning it removes our blind beliefs and ignorance. In the end, nothing is gained on the PoK.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=5&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5i9vf-10d5a5f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
What is known? What is the knowledge of?	Nothing is known. Knowledge is of the illusion only.	God is known. Knowledge is of God	The knowledge of Existence	We know our true nature and experience the true Self	The Experiencer is known directly through meditative practice	Ignorance is known. Knowledge is ignorance.	Since knowledge is an organization of Experience, and all Experience is false, we say that knowledge is ignorance. In the end, nothing is known on the Path of Knowledge, we only become that which we always were, which is the Experiencer, the whole Existence itself. Any knowledge is of the illusion only.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=4&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5i9vf-10d5a5f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Gurufield	Nick	Verified
How to find out what is true and what is not?	Determine the criteria for truth	Unchanging is true, changing is false	If Guru says it is true it is	If it is logical it is true	If it is my experience, it is true. 	If it gives me good experience it is true, otherwise it is not. 	Truth is arbitrary and subjective. To determine what is true and what is false, one must define the terms first, then categorize the Experience as true or false. In the PoK we define truth as that which is changing.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=7&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5i9vf-10d5a5f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
What is emptiness and if the Existence is empty why are there experiences?	Emptiness is the absence of independent existence, Experiences appear due to infinite potential	Emptiness is unknown, vibrations cause Experience	Emptiness is an energy source, vibrations create Experience	Emptiness is a storehouse of potential, all things arise from the substance of Emptiness	Emptiness is the void that all change returns to. Experiences are present from that change.	Emptiness is God, God creates Experience	Emptiness is the absence of a tangible, independently existing substance, essence, or building block. We come to the realization that we are the Experiencer and the Experiencer is the whole Existence. When we look to see what the Experiencer actually is, we find nothing. There are no objective features, only pure subjectivity. Experience is an appearance with dependent existence. Experience is a propagation of multiple illusions (an object, sensed by the senses, and impressed on the memory). If an Experience is dependent on illusions which are themselves empty, then it too must be empty. Therefore, the nature of this Experience is Emptiness. Therefore, if both the Experiencer and the Experience are empty, then the whole Existence is Empty.  There are possibilities in Emptiness. There is potential in Emptiness to appear as Experience. Ignorance is the inability to see the series of illusions that create Experience.This potential in Emptiness seems to persist and repeat which creates perception of stability. The persistence in memory creates the illusion in time. 	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=19&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5i9vf-10d5a5f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Gurufield	Nick	Verified
How is the Experiencer perfect in all ways?	Because it never changes and it has no qualities. It is the qualities that can be perfect or imperfect. 	Because it is the seer	Because it is deathless and birthless.	Because it is not affected by the experiences. 	Experiencer is not perfect	It is both perfect and imperfect	The Experiencer is free of all qualities and nothing must be added or removed to perfect it. This is called perfection. Nothing must be added or removed. Bliss is another word that is used on the PoK to describe the Experiencer which is free of all emotions and qualities. It is a lack of all qualities that defines perfection and bliss.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=13&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5i9vf-10d5a5f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
When were you born?	I was never born. This body was born,	When I came into physical existence	When I was conceived in my mothers' womb	I am born every moment	When I took my first birth as human	When God created this Universe	The beginning of the Experiencer, or birth of the Experiencer can never be known. If we could witness the birth of the Experiencer, who is Experiencing that? It always lies "behind" the Experience. Therefore, as the Experiencer, I was never born and more acurately I can never know when I was born.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=13&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5i9vf-10d5a5f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
Why do we have a body, why are we trapped in it?	We are not trapped in the body	Because of bad karma	Body is given to us to enjoy world. We get trapped because of ignorance.	We don't have a body, body has us. Without being trapped body cannot function.	We are not trapped, we are the body.	Body makes living in this world easy. We are not trapped. 	It is blind belief and indoctrination to believe that we are the body. Conventionally we take ourselves to be "this body" for the purpose of survival but "this body" is itself an Experience which is Experienced by the Experiencer. The ignorance that "I am the body" leads to unnecessary suffering and when we find that we are not the body, that perceived suffering is reduced.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=30&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5i9vf-10d5a5f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
What is the key to any kind of science and technology?	Algorithmic behaviour of the change.	Vibration	Patterns	Memory structure	Sine wave	Layered structure	Vibration or change is the fundamental "building block" of this Experience. The key to science and technology is to learn the rules and behaviors of the fundamental change or vibration. Then, we are able to make explanations and alter the fundamental vibration. That is science. Some might even call this the Occult.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=22&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5i9vf-10d5a5f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
What are senses and what are they doing?	Senses are perecption mechanisms. It's job is to filter essential information & form meaningful memory structures	Parts of body that interact with the world	Tools for survival of the body	Senses are protecting us from dangers	Memory structures that gather information from the world	Windows of the soul	Senses are a pattern of vibration which format and relay incoming vibration for the purpose of survival. We never "Experience" that fundamental vibration that the senses are formatting and relaying. All Experience is that of the senses and since the senses are in continuity with the memory, we can say that all Experience is that of memory. Therefore, this Experience can be said to be an illusion, we never know what's actual "behind" the experience of the senses or the memory.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=24&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5i9vf-10d5a5f?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Gurufield	Nick	Verified

Guru can only show	Through enlightening experience	By being the Experiencer	By shutting down all senses	It cannot be shown.	The Experiencer is the whole of the Existence. Experiences are illusory and change. The Experiencer is true and unchanging. Therefore, the essence of the Existence is the Experiencer.

Why is the path of knowledge also called a direct path?	It starts with the Goal first & presents path later. Seeker establishes the trueness on his own verification.	Because it does not involve any practices	Because one can reach the goal without any effort	Because there is no path	It is not a direct path.	Because Guru directly helps the student.	All spiritual paths have similar goals- happiness and freedom. The direct path provides the direct pointing to the Self-Realization that you are already free and blissful. Using direct experience and logic we remove the ignorance that creates the appearances of suffering. In other paths, there are preparatory practices, rites, and rituals, to gradually bring students to this Self-Realization. The PoK flips this and the goal is provided first. It is also known as the pathless path.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=1&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-vjf53-10f6075?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
What are the best sources of knowledge?	Direct experience & logic.	Scriptures	Books	Guru	People in authority	Learned people	On the PoK, direct experience and logic are the only valid means for knowledge. Knowledge is defined as inter-relations of experience in the memory, thus direct experience and logic are the only ways to obtain knowledge for a seeker. All other sources including books, gurus, scriptures, etc. are simply "information" and must point you toward your own direct experience in order for their to be knowledge.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=5&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-vjf53-10f6075?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
How can we get rid of the ignorance without a Guru?	On this path without guidance it is a long journey for a seeker, unless grace of Gurufield assists.	By sincerely doing the practices	By praying to some Guru	By reading books written by Guru	By taking help of fellow seekers who may have a Guru	It is impossible without a Guru	We can not know what we do not know. Ignorance creates "blind spots" for all of us. The Guru has dropped ignorance and knows the tricks of the mind. The Guru is necessary for destroying ignorance, otherwise, there may also be ignorance that goes unnonticed by the seeker.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=2&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-vjf53-10f6075?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
If truth is so important, why is that not our goal?	Truth categorizes Experience and shows that we are not the changing, false Experience. We go beyond truth.	Truth is not so important.	Truth can never be the goal since it is always present.	Goal is freedom, not truth.	Because there is no Truth, existence is both truth and false. 	Truth is subjective and can change, hence cannot be the goal.	On the PoK, truth is that which is unchanging. Truth has many definitions. We use Truth to categorize our experience. Once we find that all Experience is false (changing) and the Experiencer is the truth (unchanging), and I am the Experiencer, the need for truth is dropped. The goal is Self-Realization and destruction of ignorance. 	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=7&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-vjf53-10f6075?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
During progressive elimination, when all that can be experienced is discarded, what remains?	Emptiness	Experience cannot be discarded	Pure awareness	Pure experience	Pure soul	Experiencer without any experience	All that changes is Experience. When all Experiences are discarded, we are left with pure subjectivity or the Experiencer. Since there is nothing to point to, no substance, or Experience, the mind can only say there is Emptiness.

Why is any experience not my essence?	Experience is changing, essence is that which is the foundation that does not change.	Because it changes at a faster speed than the essence	Experiences are many, essence is one	Essence cannot be experienced	Experience is the essence	Because Experiencer is the essence. 	Essence is defined as that which is unchanging and that which is the fundamental "building block". When all that is unnecessary is removed, the essence remains. When all that is changing or false is removed, the essence remains.

 All experience is nothing but a memory. Explain.	Experience is always that of the senses, the senses are continuous with memory	Without memory we will not be able to identify objects hence no experience	Experience is not memory. Experiences are recorded in memory.	It is so but it cannot be explained. 	When something new is expereinced, it is not in memory. Then how could it be memory.	All memory is expereince but all experience is not memory. 	The senses format incoming information and is presented to the memory. The senses and memory are in continuum.

Nonduality is merely another concept. Justify or refute.	Nonduality is self-evident. It is available in each moment, hence irrefutable.	Since it cannot be experienced, it is a concept.	It cannot be a concept because it has been proven by many great saints.	It cannot be a concpet since it is the truth. 	It is a concept because language itself is a concept and non-duality is a word only in the language.	Since duality is a concept hence non-duality is also a concept. 	Concepts are a tool of the intellect to describe a phenomenon. Nonduality is the absence of concepts and divisions. It is pure Experiencing without known, knower, subject or object. Nonduality can not be described with words and concepts will not ever explain it.

There is also no substance that can be seen as essence. We see that the Existence is divided into Experience and Experiencer.

All actions only appear in the memory of the Experiencer.	All that appears is illusory. All Experiences are illusory and false. There ultimately is no action, just as there is no doer.

Which states are conducive for spiritual seekers?	rational, concentration, aware, equanimous	rational, imaginative, absorbed, concentrated	rational, concentrated, aware, absorbed	rational, egoic, shifty, absorbed	rational, blissful, absorbed, aware	aware, concentrated, blissful, equanimous	Rationality is the awakening of logic and goal directed behavior. Concentration is when logic and goal directed behavior is mastered. In the aware state, the knowledge of the Experiencer arises. Self-realization occurs. Equanimous state is stabilized awareness with broadening of attention. The absorbed state can not really be called a waking state. All states are seen as one. This is can be called the 4th state although it is not really a state. Egoic and shifty states are middle states.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=33&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-stvsb-1103834?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Gurufield	Nick	Verified
Who divides the unity of Existence into multiplicity?	the activity of the memory	a person with ignorance creates duality	the brain	the mind	the causal body	God	The Existence is appearing to itself through infinite Experience. The Existence itself has organized into memory which takes on impressions of other vibration within the Existence. This activity leads to infinite Experiences since all possiblities are present within the Existence. People, the brain, mind, causal body, and God are all events within the memory and do not explain the illusion of multiplicity and diversity of the Existence. 	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=19&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-stvsb-1103834?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Gurufield	Nick	Verified

At the bare minimum, a seeker should have an intense desire for knowledge, liberation, curiosity, and be logical and rational. It is also important to be free of mental and physical afflictions that pull attention and energy away from the seeking of truth. Mental and physical afflictions as well as close-mindedness and a lack of critical thinking ability will be barriers.

Why is logic, which is intellectual, a means of knowledge but not the direct experience of trusted people or great masters?	Logic is based on one's own direct experience where as direct experience of trusted people is just information that needs to be tested in one's own experience. 	Logic always trumps our own direct experience or the experience of others because we can not trust experience.	Logic is not a valid means of knowledge.	The direct experience of Gurus is a means of knowledge as long as it fits within our understanding of the Path of Knowledge.	Gurus and trusted people are illusory, their experience is our own experience.	Both are valid means.	Our own direct experience and logic are the only valid means of knowledge on the PoK. Everything else is invalid and considered "information" rather than knowledge. Information may point us to knowledge but can not be considered knowledge even if obtained from trusted gurus or experts. We must critically appraise all information and see if it fits with our own direct experience. Taking information on blind faith only builds more ignorance.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=6&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-3fuj9-110ce3f	Nick	Muni	Verified
Truth can be misleading. Explain.	Truth is arbitrary, subjective, and dependent upon the definition of truth therefore can be misleading.	Truth points us to knowledge, it is not misleading.	Truth is that which is unchanging, as long as we find the unchanging, we will never be misled.	Truth can never be known, therefore we imagine truth and our imagination is misleading.	Truth is arbitrary and subjective unless strict criteria is used and if the criteria is strict, truth will not be misleading.	The truth, which is the Self, or Experiencer is never misleading, only our thoughts about the truth are misleading.	Ultimately nothing is true and nothing is false in the Existence. Truth is arbitrary, subjective, and dependent upon definitions of truth. Therefore, we can be mislead by various "truths" depending on the definition. For example, even if we use a superior criteria such as "objectivity" meaning that others verify what we see and therefore we cal lit true, we can be misled. In a dream, if everyone says "we also see the blue elephant" does that mean that the blue elephant actually exists?	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=7&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-3fuj9-110ce3f	Nick	Muni	Verified
How can nature of something be known?	When it does not change under any circumstances then we know that it is the nature. 	Nature can not be defined.	Through the scientific method the nature can be deduced.	Only through the guidance of great masters	The true nature is arbitrary and subjective and therefore can not be known.	The essence is self evident and is already known.	Nature is the minimal description of something. For example, nothing can be more basic than Emptiness or zero, thus can be considered the Nature of the Experiencer and Experience. The most fundamental building block that is unchanging is the definition of essence.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=8&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-3fuj9-110ce3f	Nick	Muni	Verified
What are the positive qualities in the Experiencer?	Experiencer is quality less and hence cannot have any positive or negative qualities. It is pure, eternal, empty, unchanging. 	It contains the light of awareness.	It is the largest possible component of this Existence.	It is malleable, able to formed into multiple forms.	Happiness and compassion are it's positive qualities.	It is creative and able to appear to itself using it's creativity.	The Experiencer is completely empty of any qualities and we call this bliss. There is only Emptiness, pure subjectivity. If there is a positive quality identified, then we know it must be an Experience, then who is Experiencing that positive quality? We can only describe the Experiencer with negative qualities. It can never be found, it is eternal and timeless.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=14&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-3fuj9-110ce3f	Nick	Muni	Verified
What are the implications of self realisation?	End of suffering, freedom from individual.	Establishment in awareness	Great powers	Improved efficiency	Smooth life	Amazing experiences there after	Self-Realization is realizing our True Nature or Essence which is the Experiencer or the Existence itself. We are that which witnesses all illusory Experiences coming and going, completely peaceful and blissful. When there is recognition that you are the observer of the individual who is suffering, there is freedom from the individual and ultimately freedom from suffering. This was always here and now and that is why it is called a Realization rather than an attainment.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=16&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-3fuj9-110ce3f	Nick	Muni	Verified
Why is there change? Why does it appear orderly and lawful?	Ultimately there is no change, only an appearance of change. It appears orderly and lawful because there is potential in this Emptiness.	The Experience changes by nature and change is orderly because it must follow the laws of the Existence	The comparison of memory creates change. It is orderly and lawful due to the highly orderly laws of the waking state.	There is no change, it appears orderly and lawful due to the activity of Chitta.	The cause is unknown, all we know is that there is binary change that develops orderly structures.	There is no change and it is orderly and lawful for survival purposes.	This question asks us to take change as "true" but change itself is illusion. Remember, it is our definition of false. We can never give an answer to the cause of change. We can only develop models. There is only apparent change which itself is a grand illusion. Ultimately there is no illusion, there is no change. It appears orderly and lawful because all laws exist within the potential of Emptiness. Senses and survival do not create order, they are created from order.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=22&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-3fuj9-110ce3f	Nick	Muni	Verified
 Refute the causal nature of the Experience?	There is no cause because every cause must be observed first and thus will be an Experience itself.	Cause does not apply to the Experience.	The cause of the Experience is the Experiencer itself.	The cause of the Experience is fundamental binary change.	The cause of Experience is ignorance.	There is no cause, only Brahman	The cause of the Experience can never be known. A cause itself is an Experience and thus a cause will never be found. Although the answer "the cause does not apply to the Experience" is technically correct, the question asks for justification. Also avoid mixing terminology between English and Sanskrit as this can create confusion for a seeker.

Nonduality cannot be experienced directly. Explain.	Nonduality cannot be experienced directly because it is not an Experience, there is only Experiencing.	Nonduality can be experienced directly, that is why we're on the Path of Knowledge	Absence of Experience is the Experience of nonduality.	Nonduality can not be experienced directly but a sense of oneness can be felt after emerging from nonduality	Nonduality can only be Experienced via Experiencing	When the mind stops, nonduality can be perceived directly	Nonduality is the absence of the division of Experiencer and Experience. The activity of the mind is what causes the split of the whole into the Experiencer and Experience. When the mind's activity ceases, there is only Experiencing, absent of Experiencer and Experience. This is not an Experience because Experience would imply subject-object duality.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=20&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-3fuj9-110ce3f	Nick	Muni	Verified
How can a seeker abide in Oneness? What are some practical tips to remain as One.	The current Experience is that of Oneness only. Practical tips include seeing the mutual dependence and non-separation of Experience and Experiencer.	The seeker can abide in Oneness through being the Experiencer, there are no pointers required to see this	The current Experience is that of Oneness and practicing Experiencing willl allow someone to remain as One.	A seeker abides in Oneness through Awareness practice and a simple mantra such as "I Am" can help one remain as One.	A seeker can not abide in Oneness since the seeker is an illusion, the only pointer is to recognize the Atman in the Brahman.	The process to abide in Oneness is unique to the individual and must be given by a Guru.	The current Experience is that of Oneness. The mind's activity is what splits the Oneness into subject and object. We are always in Oneness. Seeing that the Experiencer and Experience are mutually dependent and inseperable we see that the duality is mind made.

What is the main cause of ignorance and how can the path of knowledge rectify it?	The main cause of ignorance are the blind beliefs and indoctrination. They are removed via knowledge.	Memory is the main casue of ignorance. PoK removes memory.	Wrong education is the main cause, PoK provides right kind of education. 	Wrong spiritual path is the cause of ignorance. PoK puts seeker on the right path. 	Information from fake Gurus is the main cause and PoK gives right information. 	Practices done without any guidance bring ignorance and PoK teaches right practices. 	The blind beliefs, the indoctrinations and not having critical thinking when presented with information result in ignorance.

If there is only one experiencer, why is there no common experience at all among different people?	Experience is illusory. There is only a possibility and possibility is realised in a limited way.	Experiences are common but they are being interpreted differently.	There are more than one Experiencers.	Because people are different.	Because they have not realised the Experiencer yet.	Because Existence wants it this way for the survival of the individual. 	Experience is a possibility only. There is no experience and hence there is no question of a common experience. There is only a possibility and possibility is realised in a limited way. It is an assumption that whole can be experienced. Due to need to survive, vibrations organise but in a limited manner.

Awareness is needed for Self-Realization, that is, the ability to realize that I Am the Experiencer, the Experience is false, or illusory, and that I am the whole existence.

How does the illusion decide which laws to make?	Necessity. Nobody to decide, it is human activity not illusion activity. 	Based on laws of illusion	Illusion uses algorithmic behaviour to create laws. 	Decides in relation to the most lasting patterns. 	Random activity. No decision.	Based on Universal Memory.	Based on our analysis of the Experience, there is no individual who has agency. Thus, there is no one that makes the laws of the illusion. Laws arise because there is a possibility for laws to arise within the illusion. Our of necessity, there is an Experience of organization and thus laws can be derived that explain the organization. If there was no organization, there could not be Experience of anything meaningful. There can not be an Experience of randomness.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=19&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-cjyn9-1121443?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
That which is, is never seen, that which is not, is seen. Explain.	The essence which is emptiness is never seen, and the potential aspect which is changing and an illusion, is seen. 	Existence is never seen and world is seen. 	Mind which is, is not seen, body which is not, is seen. 	God which is, is not seen. Man which is not, is seen. 	 Experiencer cannot be seen. And what is seen is the experience.	That which is, is seen. That which is not, is not seen. 	In this question, "that which is" is referring to that which is true aspect of the Existence and "that which is not" is referring to the false aspect. Therefore, we can say that the true aspect of the Experience is the subject or witness which is unchanging. That is the Experiencer and it's essence is Emptiness. On the other hand, that which can be seen or "that which is" is the changing, false, Experience.

The relation between Experiencer and experience is broken. 	A common assumption is that the Existence will cease upon the death of the "individual". Although, we know that the person, mind, or body are all Experiences arising within the Existence. Therefore, the birth and death of the "person" is only an arising or cessation within the Existence.

We try to remove ignorance because ignorance is the fundamental cause of suffering	We try to remove ignorance for the sake of achieving perfection.	We try to remove ignorance to achieve Nirvana	We try to remove ignorance because it leads to poor functioning in daily life	We don't try to remove ignorance. We leave the illusion as it is.	Ignorance is not an illusion, it is a fundamental, true aspect of the Experience.	Ignorance is the fundamental cause of suffering. Ignorance of who we are, what this Existence is leads to endless suffering of different varieties. The suffering itself is also an illusion but removal of the foundation of ignorance causes it all to fall down.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=6&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-cjyn9-1121443?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Andy	Nick	Verified
What is the difference between truth and essence?	They are One. Truth is that which never changes and essence also does not change so they are one and same. 	Truth is that which is unchanging, essence is the fundamental building block of an object.	Truth is the unchanging, essence is arbitrary and subjective	Truth and essence are both illusory.	There is no difference between truth and essence	Truth is that which is objective, essence is that which is fundamental.	Truth in illusion is always arbitrary and subjective and varies from person to person depending on the definition. But in PoK Truth is unchanging and Essence os unchanging and hence they are One.  	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=8&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-cjyn9-1121443?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Andy	Nick	Verified
How is it possible that while being dependent on the body, the experiencer is everywhere?	The experiencer is independent of the body.	The Experiencer takes form in all bodies and thus has many viewpoints.	The Experiencer is not everywhere, it only perceives that which the physical senses convey	The Experiencer and the body are synonomous	There is no such thing as the body or Experiencer, only Emptiness.	This answer is unknowable.	The Experiencer is not confined to a body. The body arises as an Experience which the Experiencer is witnessing. 	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=11&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-cjyn9-1121443?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Andy	Nick	Verified
What is achieved by self realisation?	Nothing. Realisation is that it was always there. 	Peace of mind	Control over mind	Awareness	End of thoughts	God	Self Realization is simply the recognition that "I am not any Experience" or "I am the Experiencer this Experience" or "I am the Whole of the Existence". Nothing is gained, only ignorance is lost. This has been self evident always but covered by blind belief.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=15&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-cjyn9-1121443?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Andy	Nick	Verified
What is the basis on which the layered models of the illusion are made?	Change or vibration	Emptiness	Subatomic particles	Dark matter	Memory	Resonance	The Experience or illusion is defined by its impermanent, fleeting and changing nature. If we see change at the macro level we must also assume it to be present at the micro level. Therefore, we must ask what the most basic change would be. The most basic change is a biphasic wave or what we call as a vibration. This fundamental change has the potential to build endless, complex structures which leads to the infinite appearances within the illusion.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=22&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-cjyn9-1121443?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Why is the state of sleep special?	It is the most fundamental and only state Existence is naturally. 	It allows for the Experiencer to shine without any content of the Experience	If Awareness is present in sleep, you will be able to view the activity of the causal body	It provides rest for the mind and is required for survival	The causal body is active in sleep and creates desires for the waking state and dream state	We can use the sleep state as a jumping off point for astral projection	All states are simply Experiences. When Self-Realization occurs, we know that we are not any Experience or state, we are simply the witness of the state. Whether it be the waking state, dream state, sleep state, projected state, or death state, all are illusory.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=35&user=Muni&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-cjyn9-1121443?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
How can we stop the negative activity of any layer?	Forgiving with awareness	Meditation and attention	By adding positive spin to it	By moving attention to higher layers	By realising it is an illusion	By removing the ignorance	Awareness, or knowledge that I Am the Experiencer is required for clear seeing of negative actions and their consequences. Otherwise, there is blind identification with the doer and the results of the action, which can lead to harmful cycles of behavior. Seeing action with Awareness, seeing the ignorance which caused the negative action will then allow for forgiveness of the behavior and natural avoidance of negative behavior in the future.

What can be known in oneness?	Nothing is known in oneness.	Peace of mind	Unconditional love	Brahman	The causal body	Future lives	Knowing requires a knower and a known. Thus knowing requries duality. In oneness, there is no one knowing, there is only Experiencing without an Experiencer or an Experience. The unnecesarry dividing activity fo the mind is seen for what it is and duality falls away. Thus, there is no knower of oneness and nothing to be known.

How can the path of knowledge transform an individual, and does it really matter as there is no individual?	Identification with the illusory individual is no more and thus ignorance and suffering as a whole is reduced.	It creates knowledge and insight which allows for identification with the group mind, rather than individual	It does not transform an individual, the individual is illusory and it doesn't matter in the end.	Identification with the individual in the end doesn't really matter.	The causal body's desires are reduced and the individual can be liberated.	It transforms the individual with knowledge and it does matter as that knowledge can be used to free other individuals.	Nothing is gained on the PoK, everything is lost. There is no longer identification with the illusory individual and there is a return to identification with the Experiencer and thus the Existence itself. This matters, as identification with the individual (ignorance) leads to suffering. A Guru or one with Bodhisattva tendencies recognizes that ignorance is present in this illusion and attempts to reduce ignorance for the sake of liberating those in the illusion from ignorance.  There is knowledge that the individual is illusory and no one is ultimated liberated but the work continues as a play.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=15&user=Muni&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-cjyn9-1121443?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified

What is knowledge? Which process is responsible for knowledge?	Knowledge is organization and inter-relations of Experience in memory, process is direct experience and logic.	Information that can be trusted is knowledge, process is direct experience and logic.	Knowledge is information gained by reading textbooks, scriptures, process is applying this information to direct experience and logic	knowledge is information gained directly from authentic sources like scientists and experts, it is drectly transmitted.	Whatever Guru says is knowledge, it is directly transmitted.	Whatever the education system teaches is knowledge, it is directly transmitted.	Knowledge on the PoK is defined as inter-relations of Experience in the memory. The only valid means of knowledge are direct experience and logic. All else are invalid means and are forms of information. Information can point to direct experience and logic but can never substitute for knowledge. All must be verified on the PoK.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=4&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-fxr8h-1124e05?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
How is spiritual truth different from worldly truth?	No difference, truth is arbitrary and subjective. In PoK it is unchanging. 	Spiritual truth is that which is unchanging, worldly truth is subjective and arbitrary.	No difference, both rely on objectivity.	Spiritual truth is supreme and wordly truth is arbitrary.	Spiritual truth liberates and wordly truth binds.	Spiritual truth is that which is unchanging, worldly truth is that which is objective.	Truth is arbitrary and subjective. Whether someone defines the truth as spiritual or worldly, both will be dependent upon a definition. In the PoK we define truth as that which is unchanging, we do not speak for other spiritual paths as truth is dependent upon the path as well.		https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-fxr8h-1124e05?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
How to remove ignorance?	Through acquiring knowledge.	Through meditative inquiry.	Through the Guru's grace.	Through studying books and scriptures.	Through expirementing with occult practices.	Through acquisition of Siddhis.	On the PoK we acquire knowledge for the purpose of reducing ignorance. We remove blind beliefs that cause suffering. We do this via direct experience and logic and do not rely on any other method to reduce ignorance. The Guru provides guidance but does not remove the ignorance unless the studenet applies their own direct experience and logic.		https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-fxr8h-1124e05?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Establish that the Experiencer is nontemporal.	The beginning and end of the Experiencer can never be witnessed, if it is, it becomes Experience.	When we think back to our memories, the Experiencer was always present.	This can not be established.	The Experiencer arises with the birth of the individual, thus is time bound.	The Experiencer is nontemporal given that the scriptures provide testimonies dating back thousands of years.	The Experience is nontemporal, meaning we can not find a beginning or end, but the Experiencer arises with the mind during the first few years of life.	To be time bound, something must have a beginning and end. If the beginning or end of the Experiencer is witnessed, who is witnessing that beginning or end? There is no beginning or end to the Experiencer based on this logic. Thus we call it nontemporal.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=13&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-fxr8h-1124e05?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Refute the locality of the Experiencer and the Experience.	Both are nonlocal, to define location, there must be boundaries that must be observed. We see no boundaries to either.	The Experiencer is nonlocal since the boundaries must be observed but the Experience is finite as we can see clear boundaries in Experience.	Both are found in space. The Experiencer is found within the body and Experience within the world.	This can not be refuted, it is unknowable.	They are One, therefore one does not have location.	Both are located in the waking state, while the dream state has no boundaries given that it is mind made.	Both the Experience and the Experiencer are nonlocal, meaning that a location in space can not be defined. For the Experience, we see this as everything that is appearing. If we were to observe Experience in space, then the space surrounding the Experience would also be Experience. And the action of defining the Experience in space would also be an Experience. Similar logic holds for the Experiencer. The Experiencer becomes the Experience if it is able to be viewed. Thus the Experiencer is nonlocal as well. Although logic can also show that the Experiencer and Experience are One, this question is asking about duality and thus Oneness is not applicable at this level.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=13&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-fxr8h-1124e05?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is the role of senses in generating the Experience?	There is no process that generates the Experience	The senses have no role, the mind is responsible for Experience.	The senses are illusory and are not needed to generate Experience.	The senses generate vibrations to convey to the brain.	The role of the senses remains unknown.	The senses convey energy that is formatted to fit the desires of the individual.	We try to explain that which appears using the model of vibration, senses, and local memory. This is simply a model but through basic analysis of the Existence, we know that no process can ever generate the Experience because that process itself is an Experience.

The two together make the Existence.	All appeared at once at an unknowable point in time	It is unknowable which came first	The Experience came first	This question implies that the Existence, Experiencer, and Experience are separate and occur in sequence.

That which is unchanging is true and that which is changing is false. This is self evident.	That which leads to knowledge is true and that which is misleading is false.

The Guru will tell us what is true or false based on that particular path.	In the PoK we define truth as unchanging and false as changing. In the PoK we seek the essence of who we are.

What is memory?	Memory is a special pattern of vibrations which can take on form of other patterns( vibrations ). It "Stores" the incoming change and can be "Played back" later.	Memory is humans ability to recall something	Memory is storage space in human brain	Experiences are memory	Memory is not a thing, it is the Experiencer appearing as a form so that it can Experience itself in many forms.	Memory is a function of the brain which stores the incoming vibrations as a formatted sensory input	In the realm of Experience, the fundamental building block is vibration, a simple binary state change. There is also a tendency towards survival or reduction of disorder. These vibrations superimpose and self-perpetuate. Eventually, vibrational patterns arise that can take on incoming vibrations and can "replay" the incoming patterns. This is called Memory. Memory can then build more complex structures that filter incoming data for the benefit of the structure, these are called the senses. Remember that this explanation is firmly in the realm of "illusion" or the Experience and can not be said to be True based on our criteria for truth. It is a model to explain the Experience.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=23&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-xue2j-112aac6?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is a memory bridge? Why do we need it?	It is a connection between states and we need it for remembering experience of other states.	There is no such thing as a memory bridge, only illusion.	A memory bridge allows for connection to other minds, we need it for telepathy.	A memory bridge allows for remembering past events, we need it for survival.	A memory bridge is a connection between layers of the mind, it allows us to communicate with higher and lower layers.	A memory bridge allows connection to previous spiritual teaching, it allows for contemplation which is required on the Path of Knowledge.	A memory bridge is a connection between states or layers. It allows for remembering other states. For example, when dreaming, if a memory bridge is not present, there is not remembrance of the waking state. And in this case, a memory bridge is required for lucid dreaming. We know that there is a waking state and that states have changed. The same holds true for other states such as the projected state.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=28&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-xue2j-112aac6?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
How is a pattern maintained in spite of impermanence?	Self organization, defense mechanisms and replication.	It is not maintaned, all succumbs to entropy.	Resonance.	Defense mechanisms which are unknowable.	Memory bridges.	Through repetition which creates more solidified memory.	Patterns organize and replicate to combat impermanence. There are also defence mechanisms in place to repair damage from impermanence. Consider DNA which is simply organization of vibration. It self replicates and is able to repair itself. 	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=23&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-xue2j-112aac6?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Which method is used to arrive in the nondual state?	We are already in the nondual state.	Through meditation.	Experiencing only	By silencing the mind	By moving out of the experience	By moving to higher layers	This current experience is that of Oneness and that of nonduality. Our ignorance covers the nondual truth. No method can be used to "achieve nonduality". Nonduality is not an experience and thus can not be experienced. There are practical tips which can help remove ignorance to see that we are already in the nondual state. Also, there is no "I" or "me" that can arrive in the nondual state.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=20&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-xue2j-112aac6?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Am I with qualities or without?	I am without qualities.	My qualities are happiness and compassion.	I am without qualities until I take the form of a human body.	My only quality is bliss, freedom, and compassion.	It can not be known if "I" am without qualities.	I am endless only.	The Experiencer is pure subjectivity. It is the aspect of the Existence which is true, or always present, it is the Existence itself. If we see the Experiencer as having qualities, then who is seeing the qualities? The Experiencer is always "behind" the objects it does not have any characteristics. We can't even say that the Experiencer is "endless" because "endless" implies a beginning. It is eternal.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=14&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-xue2j-112aac6?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified

Why is knowledge ignorance?	Knowledge is organisation of experiences and all experiences are illusion	Knowledge is not ignorance. 	Knowledge if incomplete can be ignorance. 	If not given by Guru then knowledge is ignorance	Knowledge is ignorance because one thinks one knows everything. 	Knowledge through direct experience is not ignorance. 	Knowledge is defined as organization of Experience in memory. We know that Experience is changing and false, thus it is knowledge of the illusion that is acquired. Thus, all knowledge is ignorance.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=4&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5tnq5-1140e9a?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
Is direct experience via senses a valid means of knowledge?	Yes, but we need to always test it by using the intellect	Yes it is valid means, what senses tell is the ultimate	No it is not since since senses can give wrong information too. 	It is valid means of knowledge under the guidance of a Guru	Knowledge cannot be obtained through senses	Senses only add to ignorance through creating desires. 	Direct experience is possible through senses and is valid means of knowledge but we need to always test it by using the intellect. It is not relaibale as it is, until logic is applied. It is the only way. We purify experience throgh logic and it becomes knowledge.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=5&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5tnq5-1140e9a?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
Can we rely on truth for conducting our actions?	No, we use the false (illusion) to take our actions.	Yes we rely on our criteria of truth. 	We cannot act if we do not have truth.	Our actions are expression of our truth. 	There is no connection between truth and actions.	We act irrespective of truth or false. 	We set our own criteria for truth and then use them to act, fully knowing that consequences are not in our hands. In absolute sense it is impossible to act on truth. We use the false (illusion) to take our actions.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=7&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5tnq5-1140e9a?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
 How is the experiencer omnipresent?	Experiencer is non-local, boundaries can not be seen. 	Not omnipresent since it is located in body	When experiencer gets special powers it becomes omnipresent	Because there is only one experiencer	Because it is connected with the Universal mind	Because it can see the past and future	The Experiencer is non-local and can not be found in space. If we found the Experiencer in space, with boundaries, who would be witnessing? The Experiencer is the witness of all space and boundaries and itself is not found in space.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=13&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5tnq5-1140e9a?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
What is the way to know the experiencer?	You can only be the Experiencer, the Experiencer can not be known. 	By stopping the experience	Through meditation	Through awareness practise	Through listening, contemplating and abiding	Through Guru	Knowing implies a known and a knower, thus the Experiencer, which is pure subjectivity can technically never be known. We can only realize that we are the Experiencer and that the Experiencer is our true nature. Going further, we see that there is only Empty subjectivity without substance, so we say that our nature is Emptiness. Evene further, we see that there is no separation between the Experiencer and Experiencer, thus we are the whole of the Existence which is both empty and full of potential.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=1&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5tnq5-1140e9a?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
Where are all the past events when they are not being recalled?	Past does not exist, it is an illusion. There is no event in the present either. 	NPNM	In potential	Universal memory	Recalled when necessary for survival.	Here and now	Assuming the past has a location, assumes solidity and "realness". All events, even present events, are illusory. The past and future appear in the "now" but remember that the "now" is also illusory. Does the "now" even make sense when there is no past or future?

Establish that the waking state is also a dream state.	The origin of both the states is in the memory. 	Dream seems real too	Both the states are temporary	Waking state is a sub state of dream state	Dream state is a sub state of waking state	Both happen to the experiencer	Illusory Experiences appear in all states dependent upon the memory. There is nothing special happening in the dream state compared to the waking state, thus we can say that all states are dream states as all states are illusory appearences.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=36&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5tnq5-1140e9a?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
Why does the memory structure change states?	States cannot be static since they are vibration and must go up and down and oscillate this creates the cyclic nature of the memory.	Memory structures never change states, they are in an ever present "now" which is ultimately empty and illusory.	The memory doesn't change states, the attention changes states.	The memory doesn't change states, the causal body changes states.	They change based on the desires of the individual	A cause is not applicable in Universal Memory since it is the Existence.	There is a potential for change in the fundamental state which is sleeping. States cannot be static since they are vibration and must go up and down and oscillate. This is the cyclic nature of the memory. Attention shifts from one state to another also for the sake of survival. Remember that causes and processes can be used to explain the illusion only which includes our model of the Universal Memory but does not apply to nonduality or the Existence itself.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=32&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5tnq5-1140e9a?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
By which process can we merge the experience and the experiencer?	They are already merged and One. 	Through meditation.	Experiencing.	By clearing the mind	By moving out of the experience	By moving to higher layers	There is no process in nonduality. No process merges the Experiencer and Experience, they are already One. It is ignorance and activity of the mind which creates the illusion of separation. Ultimately, there is no separation.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=20&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5tnq5-1140e9a?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified
When all that is, is removed, emptiness remains. Is this statement right or wrong?	 Nothing is there to be removed. It is already empty. Statement is false. 	Right	Right, that is what is left ultimately	Wrong, because nothing can be removed	All can never be removed hence wrong statement	Right since everything is built on the foundation of emptiness. 	All Experiences are illusory and do not exist independently, they are not there to begin with. There is only Emptiness with infinite potential. Emptiness is all there is, here and now.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=1&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-5tnq5-1140e9a?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Muni	Nick	Verified

What is the most essential knowledge?	The Existence is appearing to itself in illusory forms, and I am that.	I Am the Experiencer	I Am not any Experience	There is no self	All Experience is illusory	All knowledge is ignorance and thus there is no essential knowledge	The first and final message on the PoK is that the Existence is appearing to itself via illusory forms, and I Am That. This leaves no room for interpretation and the mind stops at this knowledge. The Existence has two apparent sides, an Experiencer which is the whole Existence itself, pure subjectivity, and the Experience which appears as illusory, changing forms. They are not two. There is only this Existence appearing to itself.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=1&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-7wnrb-115bec8?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Why is cultivation of qualities a subgoal for a seeker?	Without cultivation of qualities progress will be minimal	It is not a subgoal, the only goal is Self Realization	Qualities are important for worldly functioning and must be cultivated alongside spiritual growth	There are no goals or subgoals on the PoK	Qualities are inherent and can not be cultivated	Self Realizaiton requires a sharp intellect and critical thinking therefore these must be cultivated	The qualities of a seeker such as critical thinking, minimalism, discernment, attention, and others are important for eliminating ignorance. The goal of the PoK which is Self Realization can be obtained in just a few minutes but in order to stabilize that realization, hidden ignorance and blind beliefs must be removed. The only way to do this is by cultivating the qualities of a seeker.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=3&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-7wnrb-115bec8?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Is there an absolute truth or is it always relative?	True and false do not apply in nonduality	Both are always relative	Absolute truth is that I Am the Experiencer, all else is relative	Truth is that which does not change, all that changes can be considered relative truth	All is false, there is no truth	The absolute truth can only be known when in the state of Experiencing	The terms Absolute and Existence refer to Emptiness and nonduality. We can not use dual terms to describe anything in nonduality. True and false are terms that are used in duality and can not apply to the Absolute.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=7&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-7wnrb-115bec8?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Define and establish Existence.	It is all that is, the Experiencer and Experience are one and there that is the Existence	The Existence can not be defined or established it is nondual	It is Experiencing	It is the Experiencer	It is Emptiness	It is all that is known, the unknown can not be included	The Existence is all that is, known and unknown, manifested, and unmanifested. We see two sides to the Existence which is a division of the mind, the Experiencer and the Experience. In the end, we see that these are not separate and that there is one reality appearing to itself as illusory forms.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=11&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-7wnrb-115bec8?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Elimination method reduces me to nothing. True or false?	False, elimination method reduces all that is changing including the illusory "me"	True, I am reduced to my nature which is the Experiencer and that is nothing	There is no answer to this question	True, the goal of elimination method is an experience of nothing	False, I am reduced to the Existence which is everything, not nothing.	True, there is progressive elimination of me until there is nothing	The elimination method or "neti neti" brings us to the essence. This question solidifies the individual "me" and says that the "me" becomes nothing. The "me" such as the mind and body is seen in progressive elimination as illusory Experiences. What is left is the Essence. What is left is Emptiness which is the whole. It is impersonal and not related to "me".	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=20&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-7wnrb-115bec8?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What are the consequences of ignorace of our true nature?	Suffering	Bad luck	Physical affliction	There are no discernable symptoms of ignorance.	Bliss, "ignorance is bliss"	Failure in worldly endevours	Ignorance is the fundamental cause of suffering. Ignorance of who we are, what this Existence is leads to endless suffering of different varieties. The suffering itself is also an illusion but removal of the foundation of ignorance causes it all to fall down.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=6&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-7wnrb-115bec8?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What are the consequences of self realisation?	Silence	Happiness and ecstacy	Compassion for all beings	Love	Boost in intellect	Siddhis	With Self Realization we come to know that we are the Experiencer and thus the whole of the Existence. We know that all that is appearing is illusory, including the mind and body. This ends the struggle of the individual. The mind becomes content as no further knowledge can be acquired. Silence is the result.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=16&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-7wnrb-115bec8?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
If everything is one, how did duality arise in it?	Ignorance	Activity of the mind	Vibration	Layered memory structures gave rise to individuality	Survival	Necessity	Ignorance says that there is two, Self, Other, duality. When ignorance is dropped, we see that the duality was always illusory and never actually present. It never actually arose within the Existence. The duality is appearing within the nonduality. Although we have models for the duality that can explain some of the characteristics that we see, these are only models and are all appearing within the one. There is no process that the one becomes two.	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=1&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-7wnrb-115bec8?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
Is memory real?	Memory is changing and thus unreal	It is real as it creates the Experience	Yes, it can easily be ovserved through direct evaluation of an individual	Real and unreal do not apply to the memory which is part of the Universal Memory	No, although the vibrations that make up the memory are real	Universal Memory is the whole, unchanging, and real, and the individual memory is changing and unreal	Memory is a hypothesis to explain the illusion. The model includes the basic assumption of vibration and organization of vibration. From this perspective it is unreal. From another perspective if we assume the hypothesis, we can directly see that all that is Experienced is memory. Is Experience changing? Yes, thus it is false or unreal. Real in this question is equivalent to true and unreal is equivalent to false, therefore we can apply our criteria for truth	https://oormi.in/pokp/program.php?vid=23&user=Guest&step=2#vidcontent	https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-7wnrb-115bec8?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=w_share	Nick	Muni	Verified
What is the reason for taking a human birth? Who takes it?	Desire, no one takes birth	Desire, the soul takes birth	There is no reason for taking a human birth and no individual	The Existence wants to Experience itself in illusory forms, so it takes birth	Vibration organizes and results in the illusion of human birth	The memory of the individual takes birth, they do this to complete prior work and attain liberation	When we look at our direct experience we see a constant flow of desires which drives action. These are present in all states, including waking, dreaming, projected, and sleep. We can assume they are present in the death state as well even with this apparent local memory and body is dissolved. If this is the case, desire will drive human birth so that the desires can be fulfilled. We call this "storehouse" of desire the causal body, although this is not an individual or a person or a soul.
