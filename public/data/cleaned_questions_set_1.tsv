Question	1	2	3	4	5	6
1 - What is path of knowledge? What is its goal?	It is one of the spiritual paths where goal is destruction of ignorance.	We get all wishes fulfilled here, that is the only goal	It is a lifestyle, where knowledge is gained for success.	It is a way which leads to liberation of the person.	It is a useless activity, only superstition nothing else	A path to obtain knowledge of the entire existence. It's goal is knowledge in and of itself.
2 - What is knowledge?	When interrelations are formed between experiences that are logical and consistent,  results in knowledge . Knowledge and information are different in that knowledge is obtained via direct experience and logic, while information can be obtained through sources other than our direct experience and logic, such as books or Gurus.	Information that can be trusted is knowledge 	Knowledge is information gained by reading textbooks, scriptures.	knowledge is information gained directly from authentic sources like scientists, experts etc.	Whatever Guru says is knowledge.	Whatever the education system teaches is knowledge 
3 - Which qualities can be cultivated, which ones cannot be cultivated?	critical thinking, intelligence, and attention can be cultivated. Curiosity can not be cultivated. 	curiosity can be developed, intelligence can not	critical thinking and a desire for knowledge can be cultivated, intelligence can not	knowledge can be cultivated, wisdom can not	attention can be cultivated, awareness can not	no qualities can be cultivated, a seeker arrives with a fixed set of qualities
4 - Why is all that changes false?	All that changes is false because the criterion for truth is that which is unchanging	All that changes is not false	Change implies impermanence. it will not remain, that's why it's false.	That which changes is an illusion, therefore it is not what it seems	All that changes is unreliable and ultimately false	There is no true or false
5 - If knowledge comes from experience, which is false, how can we say that it is knowledge?	Knowledge is subtractive and nothing is ultimately gained.	Knowledge of the false Illusion is necessary for self-realization.	Even though Experience is false, the brain stores Experience in Local Memory and we refer to that as knowledge.	The Experiencer gains knowledge of itself through false, illusory forms which leads to self-realization.	Books and Guru's impart knowledge through their Experience and if it fits with our direct experience, we then can call it knowledge.	Not all experience is false. The one and only true experience is self-realization, and that is knowledge.
6 - Why is the experiencer limited by experience?	The Experiencer can never be limited by Experience.	Since the Experiencer and Experience are one, they are both limited by the senses.	For survival purposes.	The Existence can only appear to itself through a limited Experiencer	The Experiencer desires form. Thus the formless takes the form of the Experience	Nothing can be known unless the Experiencer is limited by Experience
7 - What is the definition of nature? What happens when it changes?	Nature is the most fundamental essence of something. If it changes, it is not the nature.	Nature is the natural occurence of vibration. When it changes, structures in the memory form.	Nature is the most fundamental essence of something. If it changes, the nature can never be known.	Nature is the phenomenon of the physical world. When it changes, life emerges.	Nature is the phenomenon of the physical world. When it changes, the systems entropy increases	Nature is truth. Truth can never change.
8 - Experiencer knows itself via many forms, but why does it need so many forms when it can know itself with one form?	The Experiencer is formless and has no need for form.	To gain knowledge best suitable for it's survival as an individual.	Because form is impermanent, it must identify with infinite forms to know itself	It must obtain many different view points to view the entirety of it's creation	This question falls under the category of unknowable and is thus unanswerable	It only requires one form, which is the causal body in order to know itself.
9 - Establish the illusory nature of all forms.	The essence of form is emptiness and forms do not exist independently. The water appears as a wave but is not separate from it.	All forms are not illusory	Since all is illusion so all forms are illusory	That which changes is untrue, therefore it is an illusion.	All forms are creations of the Experiencer and as creations they are illusory.	It is impossible to establish the illusory nature of all forms
10 - How can we say there is only one experiencer?	If they are many then they must be witnessed. As soon as they are witnessed, they become experience and the one who witnesses them becomes the Experiencer. With this logic, it's impossible to have more than one Experiencer.	We can't say there is only one Experiencer as each person has their own Experiencer.	Because we have not seen it and because other people say, it really must be only one.	We can not say there is only one experiencer.	There is not even one Experiencer, there are no Experiencers.	Each person shares the same Experiencer which is transmitted through our senses.
1. What happens when the seeker does not have required qualities and still tries to practice?	Without intense desire for liberation, which is the most essential quality for taking on a spiritual path; the practices will not be in the right direction and the seeker will be lost for a long time. Seekr can also harm self.	Makes some progress on the spiritual path.	It is a total waste of time and effort.	Seeker develops the qualities because of whatever practice s/he does.	Achieves material success. 	Seeker reaches the spiritual goal still.
2. When we get knowledge, what do we get essentially?	We don't get anything, all ignorance is dropped leaving that which is always there, the essence.	We realize how to be successful in the world.	We get knowledge of various spiritual paths. 	We get knowledge about ourself and the world.	We get increased Awareness	We get bliss and happiness
3. Why is a guru not a valid means of knowledge? Why do we still need a guru?	There are only two valid means of knowledge: Direct experience and logic. Guru is not a valid means of knowledge because he will provide information which still needs to be validated by seeker through his own experience. Also Guru can be fake too. However, we still need a Guru because it is Guru who will point out the right direction. 	Guru is a valid means of knowledge.	Guru is not a valid means of knowledge because we do not know whether he is trustworthy or not. We still need him to share practices with us. 	Knowledge is received through scriptures. We still need a Guru to interpret the scriptures for us. 	Guru is not a valid means because he is a person. We still need him because the tradition demands a Guru. 	Guru is not a valid means of knowledge and we do not need a Guru.

5. What is nondual truth?	In non-duality there is oneness that embraces both truth and false. 	There is no false.	Everything is false.	Truth is supreme.	There is only one existence.	Experiencer and experience are the same.
6. What is memory?	Memory is a special pattern of vibrations which can take on form of other patterns( vibrations ). It "Stores" the incoming change and can be "Played back" later.	Memory is humans ability to recall something	Memory is storage space in human brain	Experiences are memory	Memory is not a thing, it is the Experiencer appearing as a form so that it can Experience itself in many forms.	Memory is a function of the brain which stores the incoming vibrations as a formatted sensory input
7. What is the difference between waking, dreaming and projected states?	Essentially they are the same but the experiences in each can be different. Operating senses in each state are different.	Waking is real but dreaming is unreal. Projected is also unreal.	Realisation is possible in waking and not in dreaming or projected.	Dreaming is in lower layer and waking in higher layer	The brain waves are vibrating at various patterns which produce a specific state.	The Experiencer is different in each state depending on the particular senses that are aquired in that state.
8. Which layers are needed for awareness?	Higher layers that go beyond intellect, as well as all of the lower layersz.	Layers are not needed.	Refined emotional layers can give one the experience of awareness	Experience of oneness	Layer where one experiences love	Layer of intellect
9. How to go beyond the illusion?	You are already beyond the illusion right now. One only has to realise there is illusion, and it will always be there.	Through meditation.	Through grace of Guru.	By understanding the illusion.	By gaining knowledge.	By dropping ignorance.
10. How can the limited know the unlimited?	Limited cannot know the unlimited. It has to accept that unlimited cannot be known.	By becoming the unlimited.	Through realisation.	By dropping the mind.	Through special senses.	Through refined intelligence.

2. What is the universal truth which is accepted by everyone?	There is no universal truth accepted by everyone	Life is suffering	Our essence is unknowable	The origin of the universe is unknowable	Science is the key to explaining the universe	Ignorance is the cause of suffering
3. What is the nature of the Existence?	Emptiness	Energy	Space	Sub atomic particles 	doesn't have nature	God
4. If it is not an object, how is the Experiencer known?	By being the Experiencer	Through logic and inference. If there is an experience, there must be an experiencer	Through progressive elimination of what is not me (Neti-Neti)	Through awareness practice	Through attention practice	Through direct experience in the waking, dreaming, and projected states
5. When the Experiencer is without any qualities, why do we say it is blissful?	Bliss is the absence of all qualities, thus the Experiencer is bliss	Realizing the Experiencer causes joy and happiness for the person	It allows for a sense of oneness with all things	Through the Experiencer, we experience Nirvana	The Experiencer loves and accepts everything	Because the Experiencer is perfect in all ways
6. If it is all Emptiness, how can things exist at all?	Through the potential of emptiness	Through atomic and molecular organization	There is nothing, there is no existence of anything	Through the senses and the mind	It is a creation of the Experiencer	Through the "big bang"
7. What is the evidence for Vibration?	The observation of change	There is no evidence, it's only a concept	Scientific experiments	In meditative states, the vibrations can be observed in the mind	Through direct observation via the five senses	Mathematical derivation
8. The layered structure of memory is evolving, what happens to it in the end?	Dissolution	The Atman merges with the Brahman	Knowledge of the entire Existence	A higher intellect is achieved	Nirvana	Awakening or self-realization
9. After knowing my nondual nature, what should be my behaviour, how should I conduct my life? What is our goal here as a human being?	After realizing your nondual nature, you are free to do what you would like within the illusion. Minimalist lifestyle, the human goal is happiness and freedom	Helping others in need, human goal is to be compassionate to all beings	Fulfill all desires, the goal is fulfillment of desire	Ethics and conduct are relative, do nothing, the human goal is to maintain awareness at all times	Helping others in need, maintain awareness at all times	Act spontaneously, our goal is to abide in our true nature
10. What is unconditional love, how is it related to my true nature?	Oneness is unconditional love, and the Experiencer is not separate from the Experience and is Existence itself.	Unconditional love is loving no matter what, which is what the Experiencer does	Unconditional love is not possible, all love is conditional	Unconditional love is freedom and can be felt via self-realization	Unconditional love is oneness with all things, the Experiencer allows the person to love all things	Unconditional love is loving no matter what and can only be felt through the connection of the student and guru
1. What is the difference between knowledge and truth?	Knowledge is organization and interrelation of experiences, truth is a categorization of experience.	There is no difference.	Knowledge is obtained via direct experience, truth is obtained via logic.	There is no difference, both remove ignorance.	Knowledge is subjective and arbitrary and truth is unchanging.	Knowledge is unchanging, truth removes ignorance.
2. Can we get knowledge from scriptures or books?	No, knowledge is only obtained via direct experience and logic.	Yes, if you are in agreement with the author.	Yes, but only if they are from valid sources of knowledge, such as a Guru.	Yes, if the knowledge fits with our direct experience.	No, only the words directly from a Guru will allow for knowledge.	Yes, if the book removes ignorance.
3. What is the difference between your true nature and nature of a rock?	There is no difference.	My true nature is emptiness, the rock's is unknown.	Both are potential.	My true nature is the Experiencer, the rock's is the Experience.	Vibrations are the true nature of both.	Potential is my true nature, the rock's is unknown.
4. Are you a body?	No, the body is an Experience.	No, but the Experiencer takes the form of a body.	No, but the body creates the Experiencer	I am the causal body, not the physical body	I am the physical body in this state but an astral body in the projected state	It can not be known if I am the body
5. Where is the experiencer in this body?	There is no location of the Experiencer.	At the crown chakra	At the third eye chakra	At the heart center	It pervades the entire body	Within the pre-frontal cortex
6. If I am the whole existence, and all experience is also existence why can't I know all the experiences?	The senses limit Experience	Lack of meditative skills and Siddhis	The brain does not allow for an experience of the whole	You can know all Experiences at once	The Experiencer can only view one Experience at a time	Lack of Awareness
7. What is the meaning of illusion?	Something that is not what it appears to be	A simulated reality	that which is a modified representation of the truth	the true aspect of the Existence	that which changes	that which is deceptive
8. What is awareness?	Knowledge that I Am the Experiencer	Focus on a particular object	hypervigilance in all activities	the ability to note the arisings and passings of Experience	mindfulness	breath based meditation
9. How can we know the nondual nature of the existence?	It can not be known, we can only be the Existence.	Through the Guru's teachings	Through silencing of the mind	Through progressive elimination or "Neti Neti"	By attention and awareness practice	By witnessing the merging of the Experiencer and Experience
10. How to be blissful always?	You are already blissful, always.	Through the Guru's grace	Through silencing of the mind	Through progressive elimination or "Neti Neti"	By attention and awareness practice	By witnessing the merging of the Experiencer and Experience

Knowledge is of God	The knowledge of Existence	We know our true nature and experience the true Self	The Experiencer is known directly through meditative practice	Ignorance is known. Knowledge is ignorance.
3. How to find out what is true and what is not?	Determine the criteria for truth	Unchanging is true, changing is false	If Guru says it is true it is	If it is logical it is true	If it is my experience, it is true. 	If it gives me good experience it is true, otherwise it is not. 
4. What is emptiness and if the Existence is empty why are there experiences?	Emptiness is the absence of independent existence, Experiences appear due to infinite potential	Emptiness is unknown, vibrations cause Experience	Emptiness is an energy source, vibrations create Experience	Emptiness is a storehouse of potential, all things arise from the substance of Emptiness	Emptiness is the void that all change returns to. Experiences are present from that change.	Emptiness is God, God creates Experience
5. How is the Experiencer perfect in all ways?	Because it never changes and it has no qualities. It is the qualities that can be perfect or imperfect. 	Because it is the seer	Because it is deathless and birthless.	Because it is not affected by the experiences. 	Experiencer is not perfect	It is both perfect and imperfect
6. When were you born?	I was never born. This body was born,	When I came into physical existence	When I was conceived in my mothers' womb	I am born every moment	When I took my first birth as human	When God created this Universe
7. Why do we have a body, why are we trapped in it?	We are not trapped in the body, it is only an object/instrument through which we experience the world.	Because of bad karma	Body is given to us to enjoy world. We get trapped because of ignorance.	We don't have a body, body has us. Without being trapped body cannot function.	We are not trapped, we are the body.	Body makes living in this world easy. We are not trapped. 
8. What is the key to any kind of science and technology?	Algorithmic behaviour of the change.	Vibration	Patterns	Memory structure	Sine wave	Layered structure
9. What are senses and what are they doing?	Senses are perecption mechanism for information. It's key job is to filter absolutetly essential information & form meaningful memory structures as best helpful in survival of layers.	Parts of body that interact with the world	Tools for survival of the body	Senses are protecting us from dangers	Memory structures that gather information from the world	Windows of the soul
10. How can it be shown that I am the Existence?	It can be known by being. 	Guru can only show	Through enlightening experience	By being the Experiencer	By shutting down all senses	It cannot be shown.
1. Why is the path of knowledge also called a direct path?	It starts with the Goal first & presents path later. Seeker establishes the trueness on his own verification.	Because it does not involve any practices	Because one can reach the goal without any effort	Because there is no path	It is not a direct path.	Because Guru directly helps the student.
2. What are the best sources of knowledge?	Direct experience & logic.	Scriptures	Books	Guru	People in authority	Learned people
3. How can we get rid of the ignorance without a Guru?	On this path without guidance it is a long journey for a seeker, unless grace of Gurufield assists.	By sincerely doing the practices	By praying to some Guru	By reading books written by Guru	By taking help of fellow seekers who may have a Guru	It is impossible without a Guru
4. If truth is so important, why is that not our goal?	Turth is ever available in present moment. Practice for abiding & staying as a witness to it, is the goal 	Truth is not so important.	Truth can never be the goal since it is always present.	Goal is freedom, not truth.	Because there is no Truth, existence is both truth and false. 	Truth is subjective and can change, hence cannot be the goal.
5. During progressive elimination, when all that can be experienced is discarded, what remains?	Experiencing nothingness.	Experience cannot be discarded	Pure awareness	Pure experience	Pure soul	Experiencer without any experience
6. Why is any experience not my essence?	It's a subjective & seperate experience appearing in awareness. Hence, not me.	Because it changes at a faster speed than the essence	Experiences are many, essence is one	Essence cannot be experienced	Experience is the essence	Because Experiencer is the essence. 
7. All experience is nothing but a memory. Explain.	Memory is recorded information of experiences. Necessary information pertainiing to the needs of survival is retained by layers. This memory assists in either acquiring the same experience or avoiding it as per the best interests of survival. Earlier experiences though repeatable cannot remain 100% exact.	Without memory we will not be able to identify objects hence no experience	Experience is not memory. Experiences are recorded in memory.	It is so but it cannot be explained. 	When something new is expereinced, it is not in memory. Then how could it be memory.	All memory is expereince but all experience is not memory. 
8. Nonduality is merely another concept. Justify or refute.	Nonduality is self-evident. It is available in each moment, hence irrefutable.	Since it cannot be experienced, it is a concept.	It cannot be a concept because it has been proven by many great saints.	It cannot be a concpet since it is the truth. 	It is a concept because language itself is a concept and non-duality is a word only in the language.	Since duality is a concept hence non-duality is also a concept. 
9. Existence is emptiness. What is it empty of?	It is empty of substance.	Empty of experiences.	Empty of experiencer.	Not empty.	Emptiness is freedom from mind, hence existence is empty of mind.	Empty of all concepts.
10. How can an action happen when there is no doer?	Actions happen as per the activities of layers. They arise as response to the external triggers as per the needs & patterns of earlier memory.	God is the doer.	Experiencer is the doer through whom action happens without any trace.	Actions happen in memory.	Vibrations are the cause of action without a doer.	All actions only appear in the memory of the Experiencer.
1. What are the characteristics of the path of knowledge? How is it different from other paths?	Characteristscs: End is the beginning. It's a direct path. the goal is to remove ignorance.  How is it different? : No extremes, No practices, Not much efforts needed. No special diet, no rituals, no worship, No dogma	It is the shortest and best route to self realisation.	It is an atheist path where as other paths have object of devotion.	It is not different from other paths.	All paths have similar characteristics, only difference is in expression	Characeristics of PoK- Listening, Contemplating, Abiding. 
3. Why is knowledge ultimately ignorance?	Knowledge is a collection of Experiences and Experiences are false	Knowledge is not ignorance	Knowledge is ignorance only when it is taken as true	All beliefs are ignorance and knowledge is a belief	Knowledge is ignorance only when corrupted	Knowledge is ignorancy only when obtained from those other than your guru
4. If truth is subjective and arbitrary, is anything really true?	no, truth is dependent upon one's definition of turth, therefore there is no universal truth	yes, the Experiencer is true because it is unchanging	Yes, the only thing that is true is that change exists	yes, the only thing that is true is that Experience is ever-present	no, all Experience is changing and thus all is false	yes, oneness is the only truth
5. Why is the Experiencer confined to a human body?	The Experiencer is not confined to a human body	The senses of the body create consciousness which is felt to be the Experiencer	The causal body takes birth in the human body and brings the Experiencer with it	Ignorance binds the Experiencer to the human body	Survival forces the Experiencer to the human body	The Experiencer creates the perception of the human body
6. All that changes is illusory but what is it that remains consistent about the illusion?	The illusion itself. 	it is always changing	it is suffering	it will always create duality	it always follows the same rules	the knowledge "I Am"
7. Worlds, bodies and minds are just vibration, but why do they need to obey laws?	they don't need to obey laws	because they must	resonance	to obey the laws of the physical world	to support life	all vibration follows the law of the universal memory
8. Which states are conducive for spiritual seekers?	rational, concentration, aware, equanimous	rational, imaginative, absorbed, concentrated	rational, concentrated, aware, absorbed	rational, egoic, shifty, absorbed	rational, blissful, absorbed, aware	aware, concentrated, blissful, equanimous
9. Who divides the unity of Existence into multiplicity?	the activity of the memory	a person with ignorance creates duality	the brain	the mind	the causal body	God
10. After knowing that I am the Existence, what should I do to be in that state?	nothing should be done	self-enquiry	train awareness 24/7	attention practices	recite your guru's mantra	use logic and direct experience to infer your true nature
1. Who are fit for the path of knowledge, who are not?	Those who are sound of mind and body, curious, open minded, and dedicated to obtaining knowledge and liberation are fit. Those who are physically or mentally ill and those who are close minded are not fit.	those who are curious and desire knowledge and liberation are fit, those without high intellect are not	those with critical thinking  skills and intellect are fit, those without attention and awareness are not	those with open mindedness and dedication to knowledge and liberation are fit, those with skepticism are not	those with high levels of attention and concentration are fit, those without are not	No specific qualities are required. All with thrive on the Path of Knowledge
2. Why is logic, which is intellectual, a means of knowledge but not the direct experience of trusted people or great masters?	Logic is based on one's own direct experience where as direct experience of trusted people is just information that needs to be tested in one's own experience. 	Logic always trumps our own direct experience or the experience of others because we can not trust experience.	Logic is not a valid means of knowledge.	The direct experience of Gurus is a means of knowledge as long as it fits within our understanding of the Path of Knowledge.	Gurus and trusted people are illusory, their experience is our own experience.	Both are valid means.
3. Truth can be misleading. Explain.	Truth is arbitrary, subjective, and dependent upon the definition of truth therefore can be misleading.	Truth points us to knowledge, it is not misleading.	Truth is that which is unchanging, as long as we find the unchanging, we will never be misled.	Truth can never be known, therefore we imagine truth and our imagination is misleading.	Truth is arbitrary and subjective unless strict criteria is used and if the criteria is strict, truth will not be misleading.	The truth, which is the Self, or Experiencer is never misleading, only our thoughts about the truth are misleading.
4. How can nature of something be known?	When it does not change under any circumstances then we know that it is the nature. 	Nature can not be defined.	Through the scientific method the nature can be deduced.	Only through the guidance of great masters	The true nature is arbitrary and subjective and therefore can not be known.	The essence is self evident and is already known.
5. What are the positive qualities in the Experiencer?	Experiencer is quality less and hence cannot have any positive or negative qualities. It is pure, eternal, empty, unchanging. 	It contains the light of awareness.	It is the largest possible component of this Existence.	It is malleable, able to formed into multiple forms.	Happiness and compassion are it's positive qualities.	It is creative and able to appear to itself using it's creativity.
6. What are the implications of self realisation?	End of suffering, freedom from individual.	Establishment in awareness	Great powers	Improved efficiency	Smooth life	Amazing experiences there after
7. Why is there change? Why does it appear orderly and lawful?	Ultimately there is no change, only an appearance of change. It appears orderly and lawful because there is potential in this Emptiness.	The Experience changes by nature and change is orderly because it must follow the laws of the Existence	The comparison of memory creates change. It is orderly and lawful due to the highly orderly laws of the waking state.	There is no change, it appears orderly and lawful due to the activity of Citta.	The cause is unknown, all we know is that there is binary change that develops orderly structures.	There is no change and it is orderly and lawful for survival purposes.
8. Refute the causal nature of the Experience?	There is no cause because every cause must be observed first and thus will be an Experience itself.	Cause does not apply to the Experience.	The cause of the Experience is the Experiencer itself.	The cause of the Experience is fundamental binary change.	The cause of Experience is ignorance.	There is no cause, only Brahman
9. Nonduality cannot be experienced directly. Explain.	Nonduality cannot be experienced directly because it is not an Experience, there is only Experiencing.	Nonduality can be experienced directly, that is why we're on the Path of Knowledge	Absence of Experience is the Experience of nonduality.	Nonduality can not be experienced directly but a sense of oneness can be felt after emerging from nonduality	Nonduality can only be Experienced via Experiencing	When the mind stops, nonduality can be perceived directly
10. How can a seeker abide in Oneness? What are some practical tips to remain as One.	The current Experience is that of Oneness although practical tips include seeing the mutual dependence and non-separation of Experience and Experiencer.	The current Experience is that of Oneness, there are no pointers required to see this.	The current Experience is that of Oneness and practicing Awareness willl allow someone to remain as One.	A seeker abides in Oneness through Awareness practice and a simple mantra such as "I Am" can help one remain as One.	A seeker can not abide in Oneness since the seeker is an illusion, the only pointer is to recognize the Atman in the Brahman.	The process to abide in Oneness is unique to the individual and must be given by a Guru.
1. What is the main cause of ignorance and how can the path of knowledge rectify it?	The main cause of ignorance are the blind beliefs that have been given by the society or due to indoctrination. PoK removes them through using the valid means of knowledge which is Direct Experience and Logic. 	Memory is the main casue of ignorance. PoK removes memory.	Wrong education is the main cause, PoK provides right kind of education. 	Wrong spiritual path is the cause of ignorance. PoK puts seeker on the right path. 	Information from fake Gurus is the main cause and PoK gives right information. 	Practices done without any guidance bring ignorance and PoK teaches right practices. 
2. If a book says something which corresponds to my direct experience, is that book a good means of knowledge?	No it is still not a valid means because one, rest of the information there may still not be correct; and two, even if it is, only my own direct experience and logic are the correct means of knowledge, nothing else. 	Yes it is 	If book is recommended by Guru it is. 	If book is written by a famour person it is. 	If it is an ancient scripture it is	If many people read it, it is. 
3. Should we believe in the truth?	We do not believe in truth but realise the truth. On PoK we use the strictest criteria which is, all that is changing is false and only that which is unchanging is the truth. 	Yes we should 	No we should not	If truth is stated by Guru we should	If majority says it is true we should 	If our parents say it is the truth then we should. 
4. What is the essential truth?	All that is unchanging is the truth-in duality. In non-duality 'You' are the truth with both the changing and unchanging. 	I am not this body	I and my mind are not One	Trust God	There is God	There is no God
5. How can a person become the experiencer and which practices are necessary to reach that state?	Person can never become the experiencer. Experiencer is always present. Through self realisation, experiencer is revealed. 	Through meditation	Through Guru's grace	Through desire control	By praying to God	By taking on a spiritual path
6. If there is only one experiencer, why is there no common experience at all among different people?	People are experiences to one Experiencer, they will be different. To the experiencer there is only one experience.	Experiences are common but they are being interpreted differently.	There are more than one Experiencers.	Because people are different.	Because they have not realised the Experiencer yet.	Because Existence wants it this way for the survival of the individual. 
What qualifies a student for the path of knowledge? What do to when the required qualifications are absent?	Desire for knowledge and liberation, critical thinking, open mindedness and independence. Purification via another path may be required if not present.	Desire for knowledge and liberation, critical thinking. One to one meetings with a Guru may be required if qualifications are absent.	Intelligence is the only requirement. If not present, study of the PoK in detail is required.	Desire for knowledge and liberation, critical thinking, open mindedness, and independence are required. If not present, we continue the PoK as these qualities will be developed with time.	There are no qualifications, all are welcome.	Trust is required for the Path of Knowledge. Complete trust in the Guru
How to decide what is true and what is false? Justify your response.	That which is unchanging is true and that which is changing is false. The essence of who we are is unchanging.	That which is unchanging is true and that which is changing is false. This is self evident.	That which leads to knowledge is true and that which is misleading is false. Knowledge is the only truth in the PoK.	That which is objective is true and that which is subjective is false. Objectivity is the highest criteria for truth.	There is no true and no false.	The Guru will tell us what is true or false based on that particular path.

Why can't the experiencer change just like every other experience?	If the Experiencer changes, it will become an Experience.	The Experiencer does change because it is the same as the Experience.	We don't know if the Experiencer can change or not, it is beyond our intellect.	There is no Experiencer so it can not change.	Experiences aren't changing, it is only illusion.	The Experiencer can't change because it is limited to this mind and body which is unchanging.

A memory bridge is a connection between layers of the mind, it allows us to communicate with higher and lower layers.	A memory bridge allows connection to previous spiritual teaching, it allows for contemplation which is required on the Path of Knowledge.

1. Why is knowledge ignorance?	Knowledge is organisation of experiences and all experiences are illusion. Hence knowledge is also ignorance. There is another layer above the intellect whcih shows that intellect knows nothing. Unknowing is the knowing. 	Knowledge is not ignorance. 	Knowledge if incomplete can be ignorance. 	If not given by Guru then knowledge is ignorance	Knowledge is ignorance because one thinks one knows everything. 	Knowledge through direct experience is not ignorance. 
2. Is direct experience via senses a valid means of knowledge?	Yes, direct experience is possible through senses and is valid means of knowledge but we need to always test it by using the intellect. It is not relaibale as it is, until logic is applied. It is the only way. We purify experience throgh logic and it becomes knowledge. 	Yes it is valid means, what senses tell is the ultimate	No it is not since since senses can give wrong information too. 	It is valid means of knowledge under the guidance of a Guru	Knowledge cannot be obtained through senses	Senses only add to ignorance through creating desires. 
3. Can we rely on truth for conducting our actions?	We set our own criteria for truth and then use them to act, fully knowing that consequences are not in our hands. In absolute sense it is impossible to act on truth. We use the false (illusion) to take our actions.	Yes we rely on our criteria of truth. 	We cannot act if we do not have truth.	Our actions are expression of our truth. 	There is no connection between truth and actions.	We act irrespective of truth or false. 
4. How is the experiencer omnipresent?	Experiencer is non-local hence omnipresent. 	Not omnipresent since it is located in body	When experiencer gets special powers it becomes omnipresent	Because there is only one experiencer	Because it is connected with the Universal mind	Because it can see the past and future
5. What is the way to know the experiencer?	By being the Experiencer. 	By stopping the experience	Through meditation	Through awareness practise	Through listening, contemplating and abiding	Through Guru
6. Where are all the past events when they are not being recalled?	Past does not exist, it is an illusion. There is no event in the present either. 	NPNM	In potential	Universal memory	Recalled when necessary for survival.	Here and now
7. Establish that the waking state is also a dream state.	The origin of both the states is in the memory. 	Dream seems real too	Both the states are temporary	Waking state is a sub state of dream state	Dream state is a sub state of waking state	Both happen to the experiencer
9. By which process can we merge the experience and the experiencer?	They are already merged and One. 	Through meditation.	Experiencing.	By clearing the mind	By moving out of the experience	By moving to higher layers
10. When all that is, is removed, emptiness remains. Is this statement right or wrong?	 Nothing is there to be removed. It is already empty. Statement is false.
